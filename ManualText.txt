________________________________________
1.1	Importance of Professionalism
Due to our location at the main entrance of the college, the dispatcher is often the first representative of the Gordon community people will encounter. Our radio frequency is monitored by the local emergency center, as well as many personal scanners in homes all over the North Shore. Dispatchers act as the “voice” of Gordon and as such are frequently the first phone contact the public has with Gordon as an institution as the switchboard operator as well as the first person and arriving guest will encounter. They are also the primary liaison between the campus community and the Gordon Police Department. It is therefore incredibly important that you act in a professional and amiable manner at all times. Politeness, courtesy and manners should be displayed by all employees at all times and should never be discarded due to call volume or the stress of an emergency situation.

1.2	Dispatcher Dress Code
Dispatchers must present a clean, neat, and professional appearance appropriate for their post at all times.  We want our staff to be comfortable and casual, but also to hold to a standard of professionalism. The rule of thumb is “business casual.”  The following are standards that are expected of all dispatchers while they are working at Gordon Police. Please contact a supervisor in advance if you have any questions about whether a particular garment meets the dress code.  Any dispatcher or operator not conforming to dress code standards may be sent home to change and would not be paid for the time required to do so.  Second and third offenses may be subject to written warning and further administrative action up to termination for repeated and habitual offenses.

Shirts/Tops:
Examples of unacceptable tops are graphic tee shirts, tank tops (unless accompanied by a cardigan or sweater) or anything that may be too low-cut.  Examples of acceptable tops are polos, button-up shirts, blouses and long sleeve shirts (solids, stripes or plaids).  Tops may have a small manufacturer’s logo on it, but no other writing.  Tops should be presentable (not dirty or wrinkled).  Also, any official Gordon College shirt with a collar may be worn (these include shirts purchased at the Bookstore or issued by a campus department, group, or team such as Orientation staff, baseball team, Student Ministry, etc.).

Pants/Capris/Shorts/Skirts:
Examples of unacceptable pants/bottoms include jeans, leather, athletic pants, sweatpants, and leggings or “skinny” pants (except as used under a knee length or longer dress or skirt).   Examples of acceptable pants/bottoms include khakis, corduroys, black, brown, grey or navy pants/capris.  Shorts and skirts must be professional in appearance and fall to the knees (at minimum) when standing.

Footwear/Accessories
Leather shoes, loafers, flats, clogs, sneakers, boots, dress heels, and leather/dress sandals are acceptable for work.  Beach flip-flops, slippers, and other casual or novelty fashions should not be worn in the office.  Please, no hats.

Outerwear
A fleece or sweater (cardigan, pullover, v-neck, vest) may be worn over an appropriate top.  Please, no hooded or non-hooded sweatshirts, even if it is Gordon College apparel.

1.3 	Guests
Dispatchers are not permitted to have any guests behind the front counter.  Only department staff members are allowed behind the front counter area (this includes student openers).  Anyone who would be considered a guest during your shift must remain on the outside of the counter area and should not be in the office for more than 5-10 minutes. Guests may stop by to say hi or bring food, but should not stay to eat with you or otherwise “hang out” in the office. No chairs are to be given to guests during your shift.


1.4	Music
 You may play music in the office if the following restrictions are met:
•	It may not be so loud that it can be heard over the phone or radio.
•	Please keep music clean and edifying. Your taste in music is not the issue; the music in the office should not offend the most conservative person who could come in.
•	It is advisable to stop or mute music while dealing with business at the counter, on the phone, or on the radio.
•	No illegally downloaded music is permitted.*
•	The officers and the ACDC reserve the right to ask you to stop listening to music at any time.
•	At no time should the default volume on either dispatch computer be changed for any reason.
* Regardless of the “gray area” arguments you may have heard, it is absolutely illegal to download copyrighted music which you have not purchased or to rip copies of songs from CDs which you do not own. Since this department is responsible for enforcing the law on campus, it would be inexcusable for us to violate the law during the course of our daily business. If you have music which you do not legally own, refrain from bringing it to work. It is our hope that you would consider the importance of holding to the same standard off duty, as well, but we absolutely require that you do it while on duty.

 1.5	TV, Movies/DVDs and Video Clips
Video media (TV, movies, DVD’s, internet video clips, etc.) may be watched only between the hours of 0100 and 0600 during the school year. This is to assist late night dispatchers in staying awake and alert during very slow hours and is conditional on these criteria being met:
•	Any video media may not be a distraction to the dispatcher
•	As with music, the video media must be legally obtained.
•	The video media may only be watched on a personal laptop or device, not on the dispatch computer or any other department owned device.
•	The video media must be paused or silenced whenever the dispatcher answers the phone or radio.
•	The laptop/device must be closed and audio muted whenever a customer enters the office.
•	The content viewed must meet a high standard for non-objectionable material. At no time should anyone entering the building be subjected to foul language, nudity, gore, or other objectionable material.
•	During holiday and summer breaks, movies may be watched at any time. The same other criteria apply to movies watched during breaks.
•	The officers and the ACDC reserve the right to ask you to stop watching all video media at any time.
•	At no time should the default volume on either dispatch computer be changed for any reason.

Note: watching brief clips is okay outside the hours of 0100-0600, however watching extended clips (5 min. or more) and/or a full program is not.

1.6	Video Games, Cell Phones and Instant Messaging
Similarly, video games (computer or internet) may be played between 0100 and 0600 hours only. This allowance does not include bringing a gaming system into the office. No games may be played on any of the office computers or devices.
•	The sound must not be heard over the phone or radio.
•	You may not change any of the computer settings or volume, use restricted applications, or download anything to any of the computers in the office unless instructed by a supervisor.
The content viewed must meet the same high standards as that of TV/Movie viewing (see section 1.5)
Instant messaging programs are allowed on a personal laptop or cell phone (never on a department owned computer or device) and with these restrictions:
•	The chat window should be minimized or hidden when other people are in the office.
•	All incoming message sounds should be turned off.
•	Chat may not include voice or video components.  Programs such as Skype, Google Hangout, Video Chat, and other such programs or apps should never be used in the office as it creates the potential for a breach of confidentiality by effectually bringing a guest into the office.
Cell Phone voice and video calls are prohibited in the office. However, texting and games are acceptable as long as alert tones and sounds that may trigger at inopportune times are turned off.  Should you have the need to make a personal voice or video call on your cell phone, you should ask permission of a supervisor and/or arrange for someone to cover the desk while you complete the call.  This should be a rare need.
The office phone may be used for personal reasons for Gordon business only such as contacting the registrar about a class schedule or the financial aid office about a bill.  These instances should be infrequent and the calls remain brief.  At no time, should a dispatcher ever make a personal phone call to an off campus number from the department phones without first obtaining permission.  The only standing exception would be to order a local food delivery.


1.7	Cleanliness & Personal Items
You are responsible to keep the dispatch area clean and neat. On every shift, you should find a moment to wipe down surfaces with sanitary wipes or cleaning solution and paper towels.  If there is an area you notice is dusty, please clean it. Office cleaning is a shared responsibility and helps prevent the spread of disease.

In the office there is a cleaning checklist from which each dispatcher is expected to clean at least one daily item per shift (as calculated in normal shift assignments; covering two shifts back to back would require two items) and one weekly item per week (you may choose on which of your shifts you clean a weekly item) to ensure that everything is cleaned regularly.  During breaks where shifts are 8 hours in length each dispatcher should clean 3 daily items and one weekly item in each shift.  Mark the log with your initials and date after cleaning logged items.

•	If you are sick you should wipe down the dispatch area, as well as commonly touched things (mouse, keyboard, radio, etc.) at the end of your shift to avoid passing germs to the following dispatcher.
•	Please only bring what you need to occupy yourself for your shift. Keep bags and extra things out of sight from those at the counter and out of the way.
•	You will be assigned a cubby in which you may store personal belongings in between shifts such as a mug, bowl, change of clothes, sweater, K-cups for the Keurig, non-perishable snacks, etc.
•	You may eat during your shift, but you must clean up after yourself. This includes wiping up spills and returning trays, plates, cups and silverware to Lane after your shift.
•	The refrigerator may be used to store items you mean to consume during the current shift only. You may also leave one condiment container that you use regularly.  The refrigerator is small and used by many.  Please do not use it as your personal food storage space.
•	If you have leftovers that you plan to eat on your next shift, you may leave it in the fridge for up to 24 hours.  Food left in the fridge for over 24 hours will be discarded (including any container it is in).
•	It is advisable to write your name on all personal food items that you bring into the office.  You may leave non-perishable food items in your cubby as long as it is sealed and not an attraction to ants (to which our building is prone).
•	If you borrow re-usable items from the community cubby such as cups or silverware, you must wash them with soap and return them to the community cubby at the end of your shift.  At times there will be tea, coffee, drink mixes, snacks or other items left in the community cubby which is free for anyone to consume.
•	Please do NOT borrow or take food or drinks from another dispatcher without his or her permission.  It is not only disrespectful to use items without asking, but it will be considered stealing, which is an unacceptable and punishable offense (see section 2.7).

1.8	Campus Awareness
In an effort to be a reliable source of information to the community, it is important that you have a general awareness of the campus. A good dispatcher should have a working knowledge of office and building locations and hours, as well as any other currently relevant information.
•	Building information
o	Know building and project locations.
o	Know where offices are located on campus (e.g. Human Resources is in Emery Hall; The Registrar is in Jenks, etc.).
o	Know how to give directions to on-campus locations.
o	Know where to find directions to off campus locations (i.e. directions to Gordon-Conwell and Beverly Hospital in the binder and on Blackboard, etc.).
•	Hours of operation
o	The most frequently requested hours are in the at hand information binder.
o	Any changes (i.e. library and Bennett hours during finals) are usually posted at the front of the binder.
o	Almost all public campus venues (such as Bennett, Bookstore, Lane service, etc. all have hours posted on either the go site or the www.gordon.edu site.
•	Events and Notices
o	All admissions related events (GE Days, Accepted Student Days, etc.) would be communicated through email or the Go site.
o	Any concerts, conferences or events on campus: communicated through the 25 Live master calander.
o	Any parking lot restriction information, such as for snow removal or special events: communicated through email and/or notices in the at-hand binder.
o	Any scheduled network outages and their expected duration: communicated through email and/or notices in the at-hand binder.

1.9	Blackboard
Dispatchers have their own Blackboard organization page (found under the "Community" tab) for important information.  All dispatchers are required to log into Blackboard at the start of each shift to have the information readily available.  Utilizing the information on Blackboard equips us to serve the campus community quickly and efficiently. There may be training assigned to you to complete there as well, or assessments to facilitate review.  The breakdown of the Blackboard sections is as follows:

•	Dispatch Documents:  Forms, information and the dispatcher manual can all be found here.  Become familiar with the items available in these folders.
•	Training: Active online training sessions may be assigned to you to complete as part of your dispatcher training or as ongoing in-service training for the expansion of your skills as a dispatcher.  All training modules must be completed within the time allotted and unless instructed otherwise are to be completed during down-time on your shift.  Completing training outside of your dispatch hours will only be paid time if approved by the ACDC after discussion about why you were unable to complete on shift (for example a major event was happening on your only shift in the time period allotted).  Most training modules will have an assigned quiz or test attached at the end.

Section Two: Other Department Policies
2.1	Supervisory Structure
2.2	Confidentiality
2.3	Military Time
2.4	Department Emails
2.5	Departmental Phone Calls by Dispatchers
2.6	Office Communications/Notes
2.7	Office Disputes & Issues with Coworkers
2.8	Remedial Training and Termination
________________________________________2.1	Supervisory Structure
Your immediate supervisor is the Dispatch Center Coordinator (The full position title is Access Control and Dispatch Center Coordinator, or ACDC).  The Chief of Police and Lieutenant supervise the overall operation of the dispatch center and staff.  Both the ACDC and the Lt. are your supervisors, but the ACDC will be your first point of contact for supervisory issues.

In addition, the officer(s) on duty during any given shift function as your direct supervisor(s) during that shift. They can answer policy/procedure questions, may request that you perform additional necessary duties, and may provide direct feedback/constructive criticism regarding the performance of your duties. Their instructions generally should not contradict directives that you have received from the ACDC or Lt. If you feel that their instructions are contradictory from your training, follow their directions for the shift and be sure to talk to the ACDC about your concerns as soon as possible after the shift.

2.2	Confidentiality
There are many instances on the job where you will be exposed to sensitive information about situations and/or individual people and their property. It is essential that you keep what happens on the job in the office confidential. The following policies apply:
•	Information that you learn while on duty regarding incidents, students, or staff may not be shared with anyone outside of the department. Confidential information may not even be shared with other employees of Gordon Police unless necessary for the continuation of an official investigation or incident response.
•	Information may be shared with your immediate relief at shift change ONLY if the information is necessary for your relief to carry out his/her duties. Every effort should be made to pass along only necessary information; names should be kept confidential whenever possible.
•	If you feel you would like to debrief an incident that may have been particularly difficult for you, there is an avenue available to you that should be used instead of talking it over with fellow dispatchers. You may pursue debrief with the officer who was on duty at the time of the incident, or your staff level supervisors (not the Head Dispatcher or Senior Dispatchers or your relief).  The ACDC’s cell phone number has been made available to all dispatch staff and if (s)he is unavailable; you may contact the Lt. or the Chief.
•	You may also discuss incidents you found particularly stressful with a licensed counselor/therapist within the scope of a traditional confidential session due to their own confidentiality restraints but whenever possible try to keep names out of the discussion.  Free counseling is available to all Gordon students through the College’s Counseling Center.
•	A breach of confidentiality is a serious offense and may be grounds for immediate dismissal.

2.3	Military Time
We use military time for all department paperwork to prevent AM/PM confusion. Hours run 0000-2359.
•	In military time, you omit the colon used in standard time and say, “hours,” rather than, “o’clock.”  For 0630, you would say, “oh-six-thirty”, and for 1708, you would say “seventeen-oh-eight”.
•	To determine standard time after 1200 (noon), subtract 12 from the hour. For example, if it is 1600 hours, subtract 12 from 16 to get 4pm.
•	There are few instances when you will have to translate military time into standard time on the job.
•	Please use military time for your dispatch log, time sheets, shift coverage emails, notes left in the office, etc.

2.4	Department Emails
You will frequently receive emails from other members of the department. They may contain updated information, policy or schedule changes, or refreshers on office procedure or protocol. Because this information is important and occasionally time sensitive, it is department policy that you respond to any email received from a supervisor (including an officer or the head dispatcher) within 24 hours.
•	Dispatchers may also send out emails to request shift coverage (see section 9.10).  Please reply to all coverage requests with at least a simple no, yes, or maybe as a courtesy to your fellow dispatcher.
•	Note:  All current dispatchers can be emailed using the address DPS-Students@gordon.edu.

2.5	Departmental Phone Calls by Dispatchers
Normally, dispatchers should only make phone calls to community members when requested to do so by an officer.  When a dispatcher becomes aware of the need to make a call (e.g. someone calls to report a vehicle's lights were left on), he/she should radio the officer and confirm that the call should be made.

However, there are some routine situations in which dispatchers may make calls without officer consultation. These include:
•	Making a student aware of a delivery (e.g. flowers) that has been left at our office.
•	Informing someone that a previously reported lost item has been turned in to lost and found.
•	A lost and found item is turned in with the owner's name clearly indicated or the item is their ID card.

These routine calls should be made ONLY between the hours of 0700 and 2200.

For all other calls (and for any call between 2200 and 0700) dispatchers should be consulting with an officer before the call is placed.  In most of these cases an email can be sent instead of a phone call.  Emails about any of the routine items listed above does not need officer approval.

2.6	Office Communications/Notes
All communications left in the office need to have the following three items: the author’s initials or name, the date and the time.
•	This policy includes messages on the white board, sticky notes, and lost and found tags.
•	Notes left on items should be securely fastened.
•	Leave as much information on each note as possible. For instance, you may include:
o	The officer requesting the communication (i.e. per 101)
o	The name of the person dropping off an item and when we can expect it to be picked up.
o	If calling a person, mention whether you left a message, with whom, and/or is voicemail set up.
•	If you are following up on an item (i.e. calling someone a second time about an item waiting to be picked up) add a new note and KEEP the old note so that we have a paper trail.  This way, we will more clearly know how long an item has been in the office and how many times a person has been called.
•	There should never be an item left on the counter that was turned in as a found item.  No matter how quickly we expect a pickup, all lost and found items get logged into lost and found (except for Gordon IDs).
•	At no point should you take a message for the ACDC on a sticky note or as any other written note. Persons looking to make a request of the ACDC should be directed to email, leave a voicemail, or return at the next scheduled “in” time.  As a last resort, you can email the ACDC on the requestor’s behalf.
•	Any item left in the office, especially on the counter, MUST have a note attached to it.

2.7	Office Disputes & Issues with Coworkers
Any work related issues involving a fellow dispatcher or an officer/supervisor should be brought to the attention of ACDC and/or the Lt. The following should be voiced immediately:
•	ANY situation that could be construed as sexual harassment.
•	Inappropriate behavior in the office.
•	Blatant disregard for job duties/responsibilities (including excessive tardiness).
•	Perceived need for re-training/additional training on any office policy/procedure.
•	Offensive language in the office.
•	Offensive material in the office (music, movies, videos, magazines, etc.).

Issues surrounding items that have been taken from your personal cubby (such as food) should first be addressed with the dispatcher, only if you know who is responsible for using your items.  If you suspect someone of stealing from you but you are even the slightest bit unsure, do not accuse that person of stealing from you.  Please voice it to your supervisor, who will then address the issue.  Please remember that as a general rule, you are not allowed to use anything from a coworker’s personal cubby unless he or she gives you permission (see section 1.7).  Permission for one-time use does not constitute standing permission unless expressly stated as such.

Disputes and issues of a personal nature should be handled between you and your coworker.  Anything on the above list or any additional work related concerns that you consider relevant can and should be brought to your supervisor immediately.  All issues will be considered confidential and your supervisors will work with you to help reach a resolution as quickly as possible.

2.8	Remedial Training and Termination
As a dispatcher your continued employment is dependent on your ability to effectively do your job.  In our department, the life and safety of others is dependent on our ability to effectively communicate.  There are three types of failure in this responsibility and responses to them which are common correction, remedial training issues, and grounds for immediate dismissal.  While there are no hard lines between the three, outlined below are some common issues for each category.

Common correction issues are usually minor matters and often handled verbally at the time they occur or by a simple email reminder.  This correction may come from any of the full time staff including an officer. Some examples of common corrections are:
•	Reminder of how to receive a form properly
•	Direction on how to more efficiently handle certain requests.
•	Refreshers on seasonal requests/issues
•	Direction in more friendly and efficient responses to common situations
•	Sending a dispatcher home to change into more appropriate attire.
•	Etc.

Remedial training can occur for both minor and major policies and procedures.  Remedial training either occurs when a minor matter continues to be a problem even after common correction or when a major breach of protocol occurs, or a breach of protocol that constitutes a risk to the safety of the people we serve.  Remedial training may be a rehash of protocol by email, instruction to re-read a section of the training manual, or one on one instruction with the ACDC, Head Dispatcher, or (less frequently) a Senior Dispatcher.  Remedial training, no matter how minor the issue being covered is a serious matter.  After remedial training, it is assumed that you are completely responsible for the material, asking questions pro-actively about points of continued confusion and your continued understanding of the subject matter.  There is no second remediation.  If there are continued problems after remedial training, there may or may not be a last warning depending on the severity of the issue being covered.  Continued problems with remediated policy is a common ground for dismissal.  Some examples of common remediation are:
•	Emergency procedures refreshers
•	Radio and phone protocols and scripts
•	Understandability over phone/radio (mumbling, volume, heavy accent issues)
•	Continued instruction on any common correction issue
•	Failure to reply to office communication (a necessary training tool)

There are some issues for which the only appropriate response is immediate dismissal/termination.  This includes but is not limited to:
•	Breach of confidentiality
•	Repeated tardiness
•	Not showing up for shifts
•	Refusal to complete job tasks
•	Blatant disregard for office policies
•	Rudeness
•	Failure to abide by the policies/laws we enforce
•	Gross negligence (such as leaving the office without coverage)

3.7	Openers, Closers, and PEAs 
________________________________________3.1	Importance of Radio Protocol
There are many people who scan our radio channels locally, including radio enthusiasts in the community, Essex Regional Dispatch, Wenham Fire, and Wenham Police. It is therefore important that we are always professional and efficient in our radio communications as it directly influences the perception of Gordon and of Gordon Police as a professional environment.

3.2	Speaking on the Radio (App. 10 codes & military alphabet)
When you speak on the radio, only one person can be heard at a time. You cannot hear anyone else on any channel while you are speaking. For this reason, it is important that you keep your radio transmissions clear and concise.
•	Take a second to plan what you will say before you key the radio.
•	Be clear and enunciate; the radio distorts voices enough already without slurring and mumbling.
•	Know your radio codes/terminology and the military alphabet to make explaining situations faster and clearer.  The 10 codes, common terms and military alphabet are found at the front of the at hand information binder.  In most cases common English is preferred over 10 codes especially during multiple agency responses, but there are confidentiality and officer safety situations in which they are still required.  Military alphabet is heavily used and should be memorized.
•	The radio has a delay at the beginnings of transmissions. When you press the button to speak, wait two full seconds before transmitting.  Otherwise, your first words will be cut off.
•	Wait to release the button until you are completely done with your transmission.
•	If you are ever unsure of what someone has said to you, do not guess; ask them to repeat. Never simply assume you understood them.
•	Need to know 10 codes
o	10-2 Off-Campus 
o	10-7E Dispatcher Emergency 
o	10-19D Dispatcher Break
o	10-34P Psychological Emergency 
o	10-35 CALL REGIONAL, Emergency Backup Needed
o	10-37 Sexual Assualt
o	10-50 Well-Being Check
o	10-75 Food Order
o	10-80 Patrol Stage Change (P = Patrol; R = In Office)

3.3	Radio Channels and Designations
Three main channels are used at GCPD.
•	Police traffic is dispatched over channel 3.
o	Dispatches over this channel pass through the repeater in the chapel, which broadcasts the signal further (this is the reason for the 2 second delay).
o	If something happens to the repeater, the officer will instruct you to switch the radio to channel 4 which bypasses the repeater and goes directly to the officers’ radios.  Depending on the time of day and the officer on duty they may also direct you to Channel 1 instead.
•	Physical Plant uses channel 1. In recent years this channel is very rarely used.
•	In addition, we also have the ability to access and monitor the Wenham Police and Wenham Fire channels. You should not broadcast over these channels for any reason without direct permission from an officer or the ACDC.
Police radio designations are:
•	Control (Dispatcher)
•	101-119 (Officers)
•	110 (ACDC)
•	121-124 (Student Openers)
•	125 (Access Control Assistant)
•	126 (Administrative Assistant)
•	130s (PEAs)
•	140s (Student Closers)
•	D1 (Head Dispatcher)
•	D2 (Assistant to the VP for Technology and Operations)
•	R1-R5 (Reserve Officers)
Physical Plant uses:
•	Base (physical plant office)
•	Mobile numbers under 100.  (We abbreviate these with an ‘M’ when writing their numbers such as M1 [mobile 1], who is the Director of Physical Plant.)
•	Some Physical Plant personnel also patrol for us on occasion as “Reserve Officers.”  As they work for physical plant, they will have mobile radio designations (i.e. M1, M4, M7). When unsure which radio designation to use, address these reserve officers by the radio designation they use to call you.

3.4	Radio Transmissions
It is important to keep a standard format for communications over the radio.
•	Every radio conversation should begin with an address specifying the person being called followed by “from [caller’s designation]”. (e.g. “110 from control”)
•	If an officer initiates by calling you, always include their radio designation in your response ("go ahead [radio designation]) to avoid any confusion as to who is being addressed in case their are multiple officers on duty.
•	Whenever an officer gives you information over the radio, always repeat it.  This ensures that you heard the call correctly.
•	If you are given information to pass on to someone else, always relay it word for word, when replying both to the requesting party and to the receiving party. An officer could be relying on you to convey an emergency message that has subtle nuances that you may not understand to other emergency responders.
•	Whenever you are given information that you will log (building secured, clear from a call, etc.) include the time in addition to repeating the information so that the officer is aware of the time at which something is logged.
•	If the officer requests you to stand by, wait until they radio you again. They may be busy or involved in another conversation at the time.
o	You may also radio the officer to “stand by” if you are searching for information pertinent to the call that he or she is on.
o	 Do NOT tell the officer to stand by because you are chatting with a friend or someone else in the office.  Communicating with the officer on the radio is your first priority (unless the emergency phone rings).  All other calls, visitors, etc. must be told to “please hold for a moment” while you radio the officer.
•	If you are dispatching an officer to assist someone, keep the caller on the line until the officer states that they have received the request (at which point he or she will be en route).  The officer may ask for more information from the caller, which is why you should not hang up until the officer is en route.
o	The policy for phone protocol during emergency situations is that you must keep the caller on the line until the officer has arrived at the scene (see section 5.1).

Example: (102 is on duty)

Dispatcher	102 from Control.
102 	102.
Dispatcher 	Request for a jump start in the lower lot for a Green Toyota Camry.
102 	Received; have the person wait with the car with the hood up and I will be there shortly.
Dispatcher	Received.

	::Time delay while car is jumped::

102 	Control from 102.
Dispatcher	Go ahead, 102.
102	Jump start was successful for that car, which is Massachusetts registration 4, 5, tango, Charlie, 2, 6; that’s four, five, T, C, two, six. I’m clear.
Dispatcher	Received; You were able to successfully start Massachusetts 4, 5, tango, Charlie, 2, 6. You are clear at 2346.

3.5	Names over the Radio
Refrain from using names when dispatching situations unless the officer specifically requests it of you. This is particularly important for medicals, domestic situations, psychological emergencies and other such situations. Names should be broadcast only if absolutely necessary to respect the privacy of the people we are serving. The one standing exception to names over the radio is when there is a phone call for the officer on duty, Chief, or Lt. who ask to speak with that person directly not just “The officer on duty.”  In every case where there is simply a phone call waiting for them, you should absolutely transmit the name in the initial dispatch (for example: “101 from control *pause for response* you have a phone call from Chris Jones”).  Other people monitor our radio channel on their scanners, and radios of campus personnel will be in hearing range of others.  It should also go without saying that you are not to give out personal home or cell phone numbers over the radio, even if asked by an officer.  He or she should call the office to obtain the number.


3.6	Running Plates/Motor Vehicle Stops
In both motor vehicle stops and routine plate listings, an officer will call in a plate number. Both are handled similarly.
•	You do not need to log the fact that you ran a plate; however, MV stops are logged (with plate and state as well as resolution).
•	The officer may ask you to print the listing and change information or fill out the verbal warning section.
o	To print, you need to be in the initial listing screen (the screen that shows all the search results). The print button is to the left of the listing.
o	Always circle the current plate number or sticker number for the vehicle involved as some people have had several cars on campus and all show up when you print a listing.
o	Any verbal warnings or listing changes should be placed in its respective verbal warning or data entry bin unless the officer otherwise instructs you.
o	Any change to a listing that an officer requests that only involves one field of a listing (i.e. an incorrect letter or number in a plate listing), incorrect state, incorrect color…etc) can be logged on the added/changed information log for data entry to add clarity for Data Entry personnel.
3.6a Running a Plate
•	Always write the plate down and repeat it back to the officer to confirm that you heard it properly.
•	You may ask the officer to “stand by” while you search for the listing, but do not keep them waiting for more than a few seconds.
•	Bring up the vehicle listing on the computer.
•	Let the officer know you have the information by saying, “[Officer Number] from Control with your listing.”
•	Wait for their “Go ahead” before reading the listing. Sometimes, the officer may be occupied and not ready for the information.
•	Read the listing straight across the row of information as it appears on the computer screen. Only read the first 10 columns (they are the white rows in the computer) unless the officer requests more information.
•	If the officer requests a driver history, click on the listing to be taken to the complete vehicle record.
o	Only include history from the current school year unless otherwise indicated by the officer.
o	When listing the history, indicate the code number of the infraction, whether it was a warning or a citation, and the location.
o	If the history is extensive, it can be summarized (i.e. multiple number 20s in the Tavilla lot).
•	If a listing does not appear after searching the plate, double-check that you entered it correctly and then inform the officer that the plate is not in our system. 
3.6b MV Stops
•	This procedure is fundamentally the same as running a listing, with a few exceptions:
•	An MV stop is inherently a very dangerous and unpredictable situation for an officer.  It is therefore all the more important that the officer have your attention and priority.  Make sure you know where they are and do not let a long period of time go by without communication or a status check until they clear from the stop.
•	When an officer calls in a vehicle stop, your must ensure that you have been provided both the PLATE and the LOCATION of the stop.  Normally, the officer will provide both in his/her initial request.  If not, immediately respond with a request for the missing (either plate or location).
•	Repeat back the plate and location ("Received, you are stopping [PLATE] at [LOCATION]; standby for your listing.").
•	Immediately look up the listing and promptly radio, "[Officer Number] from Control with your listing."
•	The officer should respond with either "standby" or "go ahead with the listing." If "standby", wait until you receive go ahead to read the listing.
o	NOTE: If there is NO response, immediately repeat, "[Officer Number], I have your listing."
•	After you have been asked to standby, if you receive no "go ahead" after 5 minutes, you should radio the officer to check status.
•	Never simply go ahead reading the listing until the officer has given you a “go ahead” as it can be distracting to the officer if they are at the car with the operator, or incite argument if overheard by the operator.

3.7	Openers, Closers, and PEAs
Student openers come in six days a week during normal school operation. Put them on duty in Report Exec. when they begin their shift. They have a radio and should call in when they begin and finish checking each building. You will log each buildingthey open as a officer status the same way you would if an officer called in. Include times when replying to openers on the radio.
•	Reminder:  Openers radio codes are 121-124.
•	If an opener has not reported to the office for the opener key set by 0545 Monday through Saturday you should let the officer know.
•	Openers must leave an ID card and sign out the key set like any other contractor/student.
Student Closers function in the same way as openers except that they will secure buildings in the evening. Put them on duty in Report Exec. when the begin their shift. They will call in when they begin and finish securing each building and you should log it as an officer status the same way you would for a patrol officer. 
•	Reminder: Closer radio codes are generally in the 140s 
Parking Enforcement Assistants (PEAs) are students who issue parking tickets to on-campus vehicles. They will take a ticket book, ipad, and radio when they come into the office. Put them on duty in Report Exec. when they begin their shift and put them on an officer status with the location "Main Campus" and call type "Patrol: Parking Enforcement." They will inform the officer when they go on and off. 
•	Reminder: PEA radio codes are generally in the 130s

________________________________________4.1 	General Phone Policies
As a dispatcher, one of your main tasks will be answering the phone and dispatching calls accordingly. It is extremely important that you know phone policy and procedure, and that you quickly and effectively deal with calls.  It is also important that you follow the scripts provided for the situations they are intended for.

Personal Information
•	No personal information can be given out to any individual (officers excluded).
o	This includes home phone number, cell phone number, home address, ID number, room number or residence hall, or any other information we may have.
o	Do not give out a person’s Gordon email address to any person.  If the person claims to be from the Gordon community, you can direct them to the Go site under people search where they can search for an email address.
o	If you feel that there may be an exception (like a professor asking for information), you must first obtain the officer on duty’s permission to give this information out.
o	If people ask you why, you may explain to them that it is a college policy for security reasons. We have no authorization to give out personal information.  If they want to know more, they can inquire of the Chief.
Giving out and connecting to campus numbers
•	We may only give out campus extensions if they are listed in the phone itself, or the online operator database (bookmarked).  Any number listed in the online operator database is considered public and may be given to any caller.  Therefore, the online phone lookup should be our primary resource for transferring calls and giving out campus phone extensions.
•	Master Phone contains more information that the online lookup and the extra information is mostly for our internal use only.  The online lookup is also more frequently updated than Master Phone and the extensions are more reliable.
•	The Go site “people search” should never be used to give information on a person or to find a phone number to connect someone to.  This information is not completely public as it requires a username and password to access and there are varying levels of access (our officers can see private cell phones and emergency contact information that students do not).
•	We never connect to off-campus numbers unless specifically directed to do so by the officer (such as connecting to their cell phones) as this bills the continued phone conversation (after you release them) back to the college.
Receiving Collect Calls
•	As a general rule, we actually do NOT accept collect calls. Should you receive one on any line, please tell the operator that you do not have the authority to accept the charges and will need to speak with a supervisor (the Duty Officer) first.  Be sure to ask the operator to provide you with the full name of the person calling and the reason for the call. Then, contact the Duty Officer and let them determine whether or not, the call should be accepted. Either way (whether we accept/decline the call), the call should be entered on your log.
Calls for the Officer
•	First get the name of the calling party.
•	Tell the caller, “I will see if [he or she] is available, please hold”.
•	If someone calls for the officer on duty, radio the officer to ask if he/she can receive the call.
o	At no time should you ever take a message for the officer on duty unless you are instructed to do so.
o	At no time should you ever transfer a caller to the officer’s cell phone unless they have given you permission or direction to do so (obtained by radio).
o	At no time should you transfer a caller to a department administrator’s extension (Chief, Lt., ACDC) without either radioing them to see if they can receive the call, or staying on the line with the transfer to get permission before releasing the call.  They will always expect you to have gathered the name of the person calling.
•	If someone calls for a specific officer, first ask the officer on duty if that person is currently on campus.
o	If you know the person is on campus, ask them directly if they can receive a call.
•	If the person requested is confirmed not on campus, ask the caller if another officer can assist them.
o	People will frequently call for a specific officer because the officer was on duty when an incident occurred or because they have dealt with the officer in the past.  Check to make sure that this is a personal call and not an issue that can be dealt with by another officer.
o	If another officer cannot help, offer to take a message.
	Use a whole piece of paper for the message.
	Include a call back number, your initials and the date and time of the call.
	Place written messages in the officer’s box.
	Note: The Chief, Lt. and ACDC, have their own phone line voicemail boxes.  It is best to transfer callers directly to their voice mailbox and have them leave messages there (see section 4.2.).
Department Schedules
•	We consider officers’ and dispatchers’ work schedules to be private information and we do not give them to people outside our department.
•	If someone wants to know when a particular dispatcher is working, they can be instructed to email him or her and ask personally (reminder: do not give out dispatcher emails).
•	If some asks about an officer’s schedule, ask if another officer can help them.  If not, offer to take a message (if it is for the Chief or Lt., or ACDC you can forward the call straight to voicemail).
Dispatcher Cell Numbers
•	Dispatchers are required to provide cell phone numbers so that we have a method of reaching them if they do not show up for a shift.
•	Dispatcher cell numbers should only be used in shift coverage circumstances.
•	This information is for department use only. Do NOT give these numbers to anyone outside of the department.
•	Dispatcher cell numbers can be found on the Dispatcher Call list and are also entered into the operator phone as speed dials.  You can find the ACDC’s cell number as speed dials there as well.

4.2	Phone Explanation and Use

The Alcatel ipTouch Phones (you will be shown physical phone use during active training)
The two primary phones used for most of our business are Alcatel VOIP (Voice Over Internet Protocols) phones.  These two phones require both power and network to function correctly (see backup phones section 4.4a).  There are two phones both with speed dial extension sets attached to the right of them.  Specific functioning of the phones will be covered during your first active training session.
Phone Preset Buttons
•	Hold/F1: places the current call on hold.
•	Trans/F2: If pressed with one caller on the line, you can then enter a number/press a speed dial number to transfer a call. If you neither hang up nor press transfer again to release the call, you can speak to the person whose number you are dialing while the caller you are transferring is on hold.  If once the person you are dialing picks up, you press the soft key next to the screen display that says “Conference,” you will initiate a conference call with yourself and both of the other lines.
•	Redial: Dials the last number called.
•	Back Button (silver button): returns you to the last function. You will use this button if you misdial a name when looking up the number or wish to return to the call after searching for a name.
•	Speaker (larger green button): Places a call on speakerphone if you are currently using the receiver. After ‘speaker’ has been pressed, the receiver can be replaced without hanging up the call. To hang up a call while on speaker, either lift and replace the receiver, or press the ‘speaker’ or ‘back’ key while the receiver is in the cradle.
•	Message (red button): Used to check messages on the phone. There should never be messages on our phone.
•	Mute (smaller green button): Mutes your side of the phone call.  We use this regularly when connecting emergency calls to the Regional Dispatch Center as a conference call.
Speed Dial Numbers
Department Lines
•	Essex Regional: calls our direct line to the Essex Regional Dispatch Center.
•	Officer: Upstairs ready-room phone. Connect to this extension only by officer request.
•	Duty #1: The duty cell phone carried by the primary officer.
•	Duty #2: The duty cell carried by the first officer working double coverage.
•	Additionally there are speed dials for office administrators listed by first name, officer personal cell phone numbers listed by their badge number, and commonly called physical plant personnel listed by their Mobile number.
Operator Lines
Speed dials listed on this phone consist of dispatcher and ACDC numbers via the speed dials on the screen as well as commonly requested office numbers on the speed dial attachment.
Incoming lines (Specific handling of lines is discussed below)
•	4000 (and 4513-4514) (Gordon College lines answered as the campus Operator)
•	4444(and 4445) (Gordon Police Business line)
•	3333(and 3334) (Gordon College Emergency line)
General Phone Use
•	When you pick up the receiver on the main (front) dispatch phone to dial a number, you will automatically be on line 3333, unless there is an incoming call.
o	When the phone rings, a phone symbol will slowly blink next to the line receiving the call.
o	Pressing the button next to a line will either select an incoming or on-hold call, or dial to the number as a speed dial.
•	The operator lines will ring on the ACDC (back desk) phone as well as several phones in CTS, and the Chief’s line and ready room line upstairs if the line goes unanswered after a set period of time.  This feature is for use when you are legitimately busy with an emergency.
•	During the business day, CTS front desk staff also receive the operator lines.  It is however not their primary job, rather yours.  They are only there to help spillover when we are very busy.
•	NEVER just let the operator line ring for CTS to pick up unless you have a legitimate reason.
•	After hours and during breaks CTS will not answer the lines and you need to be more prepared to answer quickly just to put on hold by saying “Gordon College Operator, please hold” when you are unable to handle the call.
•	If the receiver is in the cradle while you select a line, it will select speakerphone. While communicating on a selected line, there will be a solid line next to the line you are on.
•	The phone has a built in phonebook feature. The numbers in this phonebook are the most up-to-date that we have access to.  To access this feature simply:
o	Start typing a last name, first name, initials, or office name (such as CTS).  You may search partial listings such as “cen” instead of “center.”
o	Press either name, 1st name, or initials on the screen display to search.
o	To call the number, press the key next to the correct listing
o	Use the arrows to navigate through more than one page of results
o	If you need to try again, press the back button to modify the search or end to end the search and start again.
o	While you are using this feature, the caller will automatically be placed on hold. 
•	You can use the phonebook feature while already on the line to transfer or initiate a conference call.
•	You can access the speed dials that are normally on the screen to transfer to by hitting “transfer” then “speed dial.”
•	You cannot transfer or initiate a conference call with a person who you called out to (rather than the caller calling in to you) unless you hit “transfer” first.  While this is not required for all calls, it is good practice to always hit transfer first so that it does not throw you off when you forget about this quirk of the phone system.
•	To access the screen speed dials when you pick up the receiver when there is not a caller on the line, press the button next to “speed dial.”
How To. . .
o	Put Callers on Hold:
o	Press the ‘hold’ button or select the button next to the other active phone line (if there is one).
o	When someone is put on hold, the line will move to the display screen with a blinking music note next to the calling phone number.
o	To take them off hold, press the button corresponding to their line on the display screen.
o	When someone has been on hold for an extended period of time the phone will “ring the caller back” to ensure you have not forgotten about him or her.  This looks just like a new caller.
o	Every time you put a caller on hold, when you pick the line back up, you should say: “Thank you for holding.” Or “I’m sorry for the delay. Thank you for holding.”  If you had to put someone on hold abruptly to deal with an emergency situation it is appropriate to apologize and explain at this time.
Note: On the operator line calls on hold will appear on the speed dial attachment, but on the Police phone they will appear on the main screen. 
•	Transferring Calls:
o	To transfer a call to a campus extension, press:
o	“Transfer”
o	Press a speed dial button or look up a number in the phonebook and select to dial.
o	Either remain on the line to introduce the caller or the question to the person they are being transferred to or press “Transfer” again or hang up to complete the transfer.
o	The caller you are transferring will hear hold music until you hang up or hit “transfer” again.
o	Until you complete the transfer you can hit the back button to get the caller back and cancel the transfer.
•	Transferring Directly to Voicemail (only do this for the Chief, Lt. and ACDC):
o	Press “transfer”
o	Dial *2
o	Dial the person’s extension
o	Press “transfer” again or hang up.
o	If you delay hitting ‘release’, you may cut off the mailbox recording.
•	Conference Calling
o	While on the line with the caller press “transfer.”
o	Dial the number or press the speed dial of the person you want to conference in.
o	Once the person you are conferencing in answers the line press “Conference.”
o	You can repeat this as many times as you need with as many lines as is required.

4.3	Specific Lines: Order of Importance and Handling
Multiple lines come in to the office and each one is handled differently. We receive both emergency and non-emergency calls for Gordon Police and we also function as the operator. Due to the volume of calls, it is sometimes necessary that we triage calls. Our phone lines are as follows:
4.3a - 3333
•	This is the emergency line that campus callers use during an emergency.  This line is recorded and you must, by law, tell callers so.
o	Ext. 4333 is the former emergency line, and will also ring as 3333.
o	Anyone who dials 911 from any campus phone will dial to the Essex Regional Dispatch Center but also will ring as a “listen only” call on x3333.  You will be able to hear their conversation but not speak. Handle these calls as if the request came directly to you.
o	Hot Phones (emergency phones located strategically around the campus) automatically dial this number.
•	This phone will ring on the main phone and also, with a significantly different ring, on the emergency backup phone over the main console (for emergency protocol, see section 5).
•	When the program is running and the network is up, the dispatch computer will also ring an alarm when this phone rings and pop up a caller ID box that will give a phone number and campus location if the caller is calling from a campus phone.
•	The 3333 emergency line is our main priority!
o	This line should not ring more than once.  Everything should be dropped to answer this line as soon as possible.
o	If you are on another line you should immediately put that person on hold and answer the emergency line.  It is suggested that you say quickly and clearly “I’m sorry, please hold.”  After you are finished with the emergency line, you should then pick up the call you had on hold and apologize and explain that you had to put them on hold suddenly due to a call on the emergency line.
•	Answer this line: “Gordon College Emergency Center, this line is recorded?”
•	Never put this line on hold (except in the rare case that you get a second emergency line call).
o	The best course of action if another emergency call comes in is to quickly conference the first emergency with regional, hang up, and then take the second emergency call. 
o	If you are in a conference call you must hang up the phone before taking another call. Otherwise, the conference call will fail on all three of the connected lines and regional will no longer be talking to the caller. 
o	If a second call comes in on the emergency line, it is significantly less noticeable.  The computer will give its alert and you will hear a call waiting like beep on the phone.
•	Only hang up when the officer arrives on scene, unless circumstances prevent the caller from remaining on the line (for example, if they are calling from a room phone reporting smoke in the building).
•	If someone calls in with a non-emergency Police call, inform the caller that they have dialed the wrong number and then transfer him or her to the 4444 line to free up the emergency line.
Accidental calls and hang-ups
Occasionally, we will receive accidental calls and hang-ups on this line. Regardless of the suspected cause of the call, you should always follow up on the call.
•	When you receive a call with no response or a hang up on the emergency line, you should note the caller ID from computer and attempt to call back to verify that everything is all right.
o	If you are unable to reach the original caller, notify the officer immediately so that he or she may verify that everything is OK at the call location.
o	Emergency line hang-ups from a cell phone are much harder to trace, so it is very important to try and make contact with the person and to check the caller ID.
o	In the case of a disconnection, accidental call, or hang up where the caller dialed 911, the Essex Regional Dispatch Center will call you back as if you had dialed 911.  This is because their caller ID reports only Gordon College and your number as the phone number.  You should give them the caller’s location and number and inform them if the officer is going to investigate or not.
•	You may have instances where someone is trying to use a calling card, make an international call or send a fax that begins 1 (1**) ***-****.  They have to first dial 9, resulting in dialing 9-1-1. Most people will hang up when they realize that they have reached the emergency line.
•	“Hot Phones” will sometimes call in without an emergency due to technical trouble, background noise, or people pushing the emergency button accidentally or for fun.  If a hot phone falls off the hook, it will repeatedly call the emergency line with no answer.  If this happens during your shift, notify the officer of the phone’s location so he or she can check on it.

4.3b – 4444 (and 4445)
•	Ext. 4444 is our primary business line.
•	This line has priority second to that of the emergency line.
o	Some people only know this number and not our emergency number, resulting in emergencies coming in on this line.
•	This line should not ring more than 4 times (unless there is a caller on the emergency line).
•	Answer this line “Gordon Police, [first name] speaking, how may I help you?”
•	Most requests for the officers and other important requests will come from this line.
o	Unfortunately, some people are under the misconception that Gordon Police is the same as the Gordon Switchboard Operator and will call our business line for phone numbers. This misconception can slow our service and ability to get to higher priority calls fast.
	If you receive a call on this line for a number, inform the caller of the direct dial line to the operator (978-927-2300 or ext. 4000).
	You can then transfer them to the operator.
	As we function in conjunction with CTS as the operator, we will essentially be transferring them back to our office.  This may seem redundant, but we want people to understand that Gordon Police is not the same as the Operator even though we answer that line.
	You can also inform them of the operator number for future reference (Ext. 4000 or 978-927-2300).
	It is recommended that you not connect them to the number without ‘retraining’ them first as this will help cut down on the habit of calling 4444 for call transfers. There will be obvious exceptions where you have no time to do so and just need them off the line quick.
4.3c – Operator Phone lines and Gordon College Phone lines (4000 adn 4513)
These two sources ring to the same “campus” phone line.  This is the listed college number (978-927-2300) as well as the number reached if anyone dials 0 from any on campus number
•	This line has a lower priority than the previous numbers.
•	Just because this number is lower priority, it does not mean that it can be ignored or that you can postpone answering it if you are not otherwise occupied on the 3333 or 4444 numbers or with the radio.  Even if there is an officer needing assistance on the radio it is appropriate to at least answer the line and say “Gordon College Operator, please hold.”  This way the caller knows that there is someone on the other line and that they are not being ignored.
•	Remember that every call on the operator line could be a possible donor or prospective student, trustee, or even the president of the College.  Even though this is not our primary role as dispatchers it is important that we always treat every caller with respect, and manners.  If you need to answer and put them directly on hold, be sure to apologize and thank them for holding when you do pick the line back up.
•	When answering these lines (as well as our department lines) you are representing the college. It is well documented that a smile can be heard over the phone, so smile! Our positive representation of the college is a job requirement and failure to treat these callers with speed, courtesy, and friendliness can be a basis for dismissal.
•	This line should be answered with “Gordon College Operator, [first name] speaking, how may I help you?”  You may also say “How may I direct your call?” instead of the last phrase.
•	Requests from this line will usually be for phone numbers or general campus information.
o	Answer any questions that the caller may have or transfer the caller to the appropriate department (review section 4.1 about confidentiality and connecting callers).
o	In this way, we are acting as the “voice of Gordon” and we should be as helpful and kind as possible without bending policy.
o	You are not expected to know the answer to every question, all you need to do is know who knows the answer and get the caller transferred to that person or office.  For example, if someone calls asking if the college rents tubas to students wishing to take music classes, you do not need to know or find the answer yourself.  Rather the appropriate response would be to transfer them to the Music Department.
o	If you are unsure where to find an answer or where to direct a caller, ask the officer.

4.4  Other Phones
4.4a  Backup Phones
There is a backup emergency line phone and a backup business line phone above the dispatch console next to the off-campus emergency line phone (see 4.4b).  These phones are to be used if our network is down and our IP phones do not work.
•	They always ring simultaneously with the main phones.  Make sure you are able to tell which part of the normal ring is coming from those phones so that you will recognize which line is ringing when the network is down.
•	They do not have multiple lines, so it is more important than usual that you not allow non-emergency calls to tie up the emergency line when you are on them.
•	They are still like any campus phone in that you have to dial 9 to get off campus (except the off-campus emergency line below).
•	The backup phone for the 4444 line can be used as a caller ID to get call back numbers in many circumstances.  Not every number registers, so make sure to double check the date and time of the call before using the number.  To get these numbers press the back arrow button.
•	The number for the Regional Center is printed on the front of the off-campus emergency phone in case you need to direct dial the number.
4.4b Off-Campus Emergency Line
•	The number for this phone is 978-922-9135.
•	This phone is located above the dispatch console and has the Essex Regional phone number on the front of it in large lettering.
•	This is an emergency number intended for use if the college phone system fails.
•	Calls from on this line should be from one of a very few sources.
o	BCA galleries: We use an outside alarm company to monitor both galleries in BCA as well as the Bookstore. If the alarm is triggered, we will receive a call from the company to alert us. They will ask for your name. Radio the officer with expediency to let him know the situation.
o	Essex Regional Dispatch: Sometimes Regional will use this line to get a hold of our department. If this happens, inform the officer of the call.  They should call back on 978-867-4444 if they would like to be transferred to an officer.
o	Dexter: Emergency calls from the Dexter phone and the Dexter hot phone will come in on this line.
o	Telemarketers: If you receive a call from a telemarketer on this line inform them that it is an emergency line for a police department and request that they take this number off their list.
•	Always answer this line, “Gordon College Emergency Center, what is your emergency?”
4.4c Dispatcher Cell Phone
•	There is a dedicated dispatcher cell phone.
•	Use of this cell phone is limited and should only be used when necessary.  We do not want people to get the impression that they should be calling that number instead of our main line.
•	We do not want to give the impression that requests should be texted to us rather than called in.
•	Answer this phone as you would the 4444 line.
•	If someone is ringing back this number or texting to it, tell them to call our main line with their request (unless it is an emergency, in which case we will worry about correcting them later).
•	You may use this cell phone to text students in cases where we need to reach them and they either do not have voicemail set up, their voicemail is disabled, or you have a time sensitive need that you for whatever reason believe they will not check their voicemail in time.
•	We will occasionally get weather alerts from this phone which will require a response from you (see weather alerts – section 6.7).
• 	The phone also has contact information for all officers and dispatchers, as well as some important campus staff.	

4.5	Personal Phone Use
•	Personal phone calls should be made while off duty whenever possible.
•	If personal calls must be made (or received) while on duty, they should be kept very brief (no more than 3 minutes) and must not take priority over other lines, the radio, or other dept. business.
o	This includes calls on the office phone AND on a personal cell phone.
o	You should arrange desk coverage to complete such calls.
•	Please refrain from making personal calls from the office phone.
•	Long distance calls should never be made from the department phone without permission from your supervisor. Permission will only be granted for emergencies.

5.1	General Information (App. Lists of Procedures)
One of the most important tasks of a dispatcher is that he or she quickly and accurately dispatches emergency situations. While emergencies may not happen often, proper execution of procedure could save lives. Specific emergency procedures are always available in the at hand information binder on the dispatch desk, but these “cheat sheets” must never be relied upon.  You MUST know and have memorized these procedures before your first solo shift.  These protocol sheets are included in Appendix A at the end of the manual for your advance study and preparation.

You should also be somewhat familiar with these protocols before coming in for your first training session. Please review these procedures regularly. They must be strictly followed, as it is very important that we respond to emergencies efficiently and uniformly.  If you ever feel that some time has passed since you last dispatched an emergency call and you would like to practice, ask the officer working with you or a Senior Dispatcher to give you a practice drill.  Practice drills may sometimes be scheduled for you without your advance notice to keep your skills sharp.  If at any point, you struggle to dispatch an emergency appropriately, remedial training will be arranged and you will be asked to develop a plan for your own skills development.  Due to the important nature of emergency dispatch, dispatchers who continue to struggle with emergency procedures after remedial training may be subject to dismissal.

Emergency situations are always toned out over the radio before being dispatched.
•	These tones are heard on the Gordon Police channels (3 and the Emergency Only Channel).
•	The fire tone is automatic in the event of a standard fire alarm, when an existing alarm is not already in the system.
•	In other cases, you will activate a tone manually by pressing the appropriate button on the radio console.
o	Fire Tone
o	General ("Alert") Tone
o	Medical Tone
Fire Alarm Tone Issues
•	In the event of a local fire alarm or pre-alarm, the tone will not go out. You will have to press the tone button manually. The fire tone needs to go out over the radio for all fire alarms and/or reports of fire or visible smoke.  We will also use the fire tone for other escalated events that do not qualify as medical emergencies but are more significant than the response a general tone suggests.  An example would be in the case of a bomb threat.
Calls that come in during an emergency
•	You will still receive phone calls, people at the desk, etc. during an emergency.
•	Handle these requests in the normal manner but stop what you are doing immediately if you receive an update on the emergency (i.e. if you see Wenham drive up and you radio the officer, or the officer calls you with additional information).
•	You must never put an emergency call on hold (see section 4.3a).  Unless it is to answer another call to the emergency line only. Although, it is always better to quickly conference the first call with regional, hang up, and then take the next emergency call. 
•	Only new emergency calls should be given to the officer during an ongoing emergency.  No business related calls should be relayed to the officer.
•	If people call in with a request for the officer you can inform them of the emergency and explain that it may be some time before the officer can help them. Take a call back number and inform the caller that you will let them know when the officer is free.
Radio Silence
•	During any type of emergency, there should be complete radio silence on your behalf unless it directly pertains to the emergency in progress or a new emergency call/alarm.  All officers and personnel with radios should be aware of this policy.
Regional Dispatch and our relation to them
•	Regional dispatch is the dispatch center for the County of Essex region.  Some neighboring towns still maintain their own independent dispatch centers such as ECO in Hamilton.  The Town of Wenham however, uses Essex Regional Dispatch.
•	Regional is our main point of contact for assistance from outside agencies such as Wenham Police, Wenham Fire, and Ambulance Response.  We also contact them for other needs such as animal control, fire permits, and information.
•	You should never be intimidated when talking to Regional as they are dispatchers like you.  Regional, like emergency callers are an exception to the general rule that we put callers on hold when talking on the radio or asking a question of someone in the office.  If, while on the phone with Regional, the officer contacts you on the radio, you may simultaneously hold both conversations as they are capable of monitoring our radio channel anyway.
•	You may occasionally receive dispatches on the phone or the dispatcher cell phone from Regional for the officers.  This could be situations like someone on campus dialing 911 from a cell phone, where they received the phone call, but our officers are part of the response.  The officers should be receiving these dispatches on their duty cell phones, however as a back-up measure, you should always dispatch these calls following the appropriate protocol as if the call came to you instead.
•	When phones that are part of the internal campus land-line system dial 911, you will receive a “listen only” version of the phone call.  You will be able to listen in to the conversation between the caller and Regional.  You should dispatch these calls as if they came directly to you.
5.2	10-35 CALL Regional—Wenham Police Backup Needed Immediately
The 10-35 code (police emergency) means that the officer is in trouble and needs immediate police backup. Officers may only be able to make one transmission depending on the situation. You need to know this code in your sleep because our officers’ lives may depend on a speedy response. Your hand should already be on the receiver as you repeat back the call and your finger on the Regional speed dial before you finish your reply over the radio.

5.3	10-7E – Dispatcher Distress Call
If a dispatcher perceives a threat to his or her safety, whether from a person or persons outside of the building (e.g. in front of the window, etc.) or from someone inside the building, the following procedure should be followed:
•	Radio the officer immediately:
o	“102 from control: 10-7E.  I repeat: 10-7E.”
•	If the threat is inside the building and the dispatcher does not want the subject to be aware of the nature of the call, the above transmission will be enough to alert the officer to return immediately to the office.
•	If the threat is outside the building or the dispatcher is free to add any additional information, he/she should transmit the details of the situation to the responding officers (e.g. description of the subjects; location; direction headed; details of the incident or threat, etc.)
•	If the dispatcher believes it is unsafe to remain at the dispatch station while waiting for the officer (e.g. someone with a weapon outside the window, etc.), he or she should immediately take the dispatcher portable radio and retreat to the bathroom, locking the door once inside.  While en route or as soon as possible, the dispatcher should transmit the “10-7E” call (as above), including explanation that the dispatcher is in the bathroom and any additional information about the threat.
•	If you feel the situation warrants and you are not worried about escalating the situation, you may proceed your dispatch by the general tone.
•	The 10-7E is for real emergencies and safety threats only.  For instance, if a group of people were pulling a prank by throwing water balloons or knocking on the windows, this would not constitute a 10-7E.  Simply radio the officer and inform them of the situation.
•	If you need to be discreet or are unable to send a dispatch for any reason, you can also pull one of the two panic buttons in the office. (Located under the dispatch desk and under the front counter). This is the same as saying "10-7E" over the radio and will alert the officer that there is an emergency in the office.
5.4	Request for Medical Aid
All medical aid requests are treated as an emergency, and they are ALL toned out.  As you are not at the scene and are not qualified to classify the seriousness of a medical issue, you must tone out even basic requests (regardless of what the caller may say to you).  You may feel silly toning out small or routine problems, but it is much better for us to treat everything with the same degree of response than to underestimate the complexity of a problem.
•	If you feel that a call that sounds medical in nature is simply an individual attempting to obtain a medical item, clarify the request.  Examples of these type calls are students trying to find a band-aid to apply to a cut or an ice pack to apply to a twisted ankle.  The distinction is this: if they are looking for either assistance with the medical issue or even advice about whether they should seek further treatment, tone it as a medical.  If they are simply trying to obtain an object, you may dispatch as you would any other call.  As always, our motto remains: “when in doubt, tone it out.”
•	When receiving a medical emergency call, your priority is to get the patient’s location and call back number and then the general nature of the emergency.  Unlike with routine requests of the officer, do not waste time getting the caller’s name.  You can always gather this type of information later after your initial dispatch.
•	When gathering the call back number, don’t just read it off of the e911 window on the computer screen or the phone screen, confirm the number with them and write it down.
•	It is important when speaking with emergency callers that you keep them from rambling.  You do not want to waste time hearing a medical history for the patient, or getting all of the pertinent details about how a collision happened that resulted in an injury.  We only want to get a quick brief summary description of the main medical issue (i.e. a broken arm, twisted ankle, chest pain, difficulty breathing, allergic reaction, seizure, fainting, attempted suicide by(fill in the blank with knife, pills, gun…etc) and so on).  The only follow up questions you should ever take time to gather are regarding consciousness or difficulty breathing if those answers are in doubt.
•	Focus on gathering the information as quickly as possible so that officers can get dispatched on en-route to their location.
•	Once you gather those three information items from the dispatcher, you will initiate a conference call with Regional and then put your line on mute so that you can monitor the flow of information to Regional but are not posing a distraction by the background noise of you dispatching the medical.
•	You must press the medical tone on the dispatch console to tone out the Medical Alarm.
•	It is particularly important for medical calls that you refrain from using names over the radio.
•	Medical situations should be broadcast using the following format:
o	Control to all units: You are responding to a request for medical aid at [specific location] for [main medical issue].  The caller is on with Regional.  All responding units please acknowledge.
•	You will dispatch this same way whether you received the call and conferenced in Regional or you received a listen only mode call to Regional (911).
•	Examples of wording for dispatching a medical situation over the radio. “You are responding to a request for medical aid at…
o	Ferrin Field for a possible dislocated elbow.”
o	Lane, in the PDR, for a bee sting with no allergic reaction.”
o	Nyland, in the RD apartment, for a person who is having trouble breathing, possible panic attack.”
o	MacDonald, room 101, for a cut finger.”
o	The Center for Balance and Mobility for a party experiencing chest pains.”
5.5	Psychological Emergencies
Some Psychological Emergencies will be treated as requests for medical aid and others will be transferred to the officers’ cell phone.  Due to the inherently gray nature of Psychological emergencies and the sometime necessity for a delicate response, these calls will always either be passed on to either the officer’s phone or conferenced to Regional.
•	You will need to obtain the normal three pieces of information just like in a medical call, location of the person in question, a call back number for the caller and a very brief/quick and basic description of the issue.  As in a medical, prevent the caller from rambling to you as they will need to tell the details to someone else and we do not want to delay response.
•	In addition to these you will need to ask the caller the following two questions:
1.	“Does the person have any obvious MEDICAL NEEDS OR ISSUES (e.g. injury, difficulty breathing, loss of consciousness, etc)?”
2.	“To your knowledge has the person attempted to harm themselves or are they actively and imminently preparing to do so (e.g. they’ve threatened to take pills, etc)?”
•	If the answer to either of the above questions is yes, you will treat the call as a medical call and immediately start the conference call with Regional.
•	In all other cases you will initiate a conference call with the Duty Cell (or if the officer specifies that you should call the double coverage officer, to the double coverage cell phone).  Once you are on with the officer and get the caller speaking with the officer, you will then hang up and follow any directions that the officer gives you.

	5.5a 	 10-50 - Well Being Check
	There are times that you will receive a call where there is no psychological emergency in progress but 	where a parent, roommate, or Residence life staff has a general concern about the location or well-	being of a student or other person.  In these cases, you do not need to escalate to a psychological 	emergency but we will investigate every request.
•	We will neither confirm nor deny that someone is even a student at the college for the sake of the student’s privacy (some students have restraining orders against family members or just don’t want them knowing where they are and as adults, that is their right).
•	 However we will always ensure the safety and wellbeing of anyone, even if they are currently in china and we have to contact others to do so.
•	Tell the caller that we will ensure that they are safe and take a call back number in case you lose the call or the officer has follow up questions.  When the person is located, they will be instructed to contact the caller should they choose to do so.  We will not call them back ourselves to confirm.  If you feel there is an exception, it will be decided by the officer, not you.
•	Dispatch the officer simply saying that you have a 10-50 request.  The officer will then call you for details or ask you to transfer the caller to them.  This preserves the privacy of the person in question.

5.6	Fire Alarm
We can receive two types of fire alarms through our fire panel in addition to notification of fire or smoke called in by an individual.
5.6a Standard Fire Alarm
This is a real fire alarm detected by one of our fire computers. Alarms will sound in the building involved to evacuate the building. An emergency tone will be sent directly to Regional, though they will not know the specific location of the alarm until you call them.
•	You will hear an alarm over the the fire computer.
•	The Fire Tone will automatically go out over the radio unless another alarm is already active in the system.
•	The RED light on the panel will light up, indicating that you should call Regional.
•	Never assume that the alarm activation is only one alarm until you confirm that fact on the computer.  Two alarms coming in simultaneously sounds exactly the same as one or many.
5.6b Local Fire Alarm
These alarms are located in areas where there is likelihood of non-emergency smoke (such as cooking smoke). As they will often activate when there is no active fire, they only sound locally; alarms will NOT sound to evacuate the building and an automatic tone will NOT go to Regional.
•	You will hear an alarm over the fire computer.
•	You will have to press the fire alarm tone button to tone out the alarm.
•	The GREEN light will stay lit on the panel and the red light will not become illuminated.
•	When you call Regional, you will state: “This is the Gordon College Dispatcher. We just received a LOCAL smoke detector activation in [specific location]. Our officer is responding and the building is NOT beening evacuated."

5.7	Report of LOCAL Smoke Detector Activation & Report of Fire/Smoke
•	You will have to press the fire alarm tone.
•	In the case of a report of a local smoke detector activation you will call Regional after your dispatch to notify them of the alarm.
•	In the case of a report of Fire or Smoke you will begin a conference call to Regional dispatch just like in medical calls before dispatching the officer.
•	If possible (if the caller is not in danger from the fire or on a mobile phone) keep the caller on the line until the officers arrive at the scene.
•	If at any point you determine that a reasonable person would think that the building should be evacuated (such as an uncontrolled oven fire, a room filled with smoke..etc) instruct the caller to leave the building and pull a pull station.
•	In the case that you instruct the caller to pull a pull station as well as in any local alarm, you should be prepared for and never surprised by a full “standard” fire alarm following it in the system.
•	NOTE: If the officer or a fire alarm technician or Wenham Fire fighter asks you to reset the system, lift the plastic cover on the Notifier Net and press the “reset” button. At no time should you ever push the signal silence button, as this silences the alarm not only in the office but in the building involved and other campus locations.

5.8 	Fire Alarm at Rodger Reception Center
If the fire alarm sounds in the Roger Reception Center:
·         If you smell any smoke or see any fire, you need to evacuate the building as quickly as possible.  If you are able, you should hit the fire alarm tone (if it has not automatically gone out); grab your log, dispatch cell phone, a pen, a timekeeping device if you have one handy, and the hand-held radio.. Turn the radio on and take it outside to continue to dispatch the alarm from outside the building.. While you are using the hand held radio you will only be able to dispatch on one channel at a time.. Be sure to check that the radio is set to channel 3..  Once you dispatch the officer, use the cell phone to call Essex Regional to give them the location and let them know you smell smoke or see fire.  As soon as you are authorized to do so, because while you are out of the office there is no one manning the emergency phone..
·         If no smoke or fire is obvious, or if the alarm sounds and you are certain of the cause and that you are safe, you may remain in the building.  (An example would be if you set the smoke detector off by microwaving popcorn and causing a light smoke condition).  Follow the normal fire alarm protocol, but regularly check your surroundings to ensure you are safe.  If there is any doubt to your safety, you should evacuate the building as listed above in the first bullet point.  As soon as the Officer has checked the building (including the basement) and found the alarm to be a false alarm, they will silence the alarm and wait for the Fire Department.

5.9	Trouble Alarms
Our fire detection system is able to warn us when it is malfunctioning. This means that in addition to getting fire alarms on our fire panels, we also get trouble alarms. The trouble alarm tells us that there is something wrong with the fire alarm system in a particular spot and that it is not working at its full potential. A trouble alarm is not an emergency and we do not tone it out, however, it should be dealt with right away.

If you get a new trouble alarm on your shift, you should:
•	Radio the officer every time and inform him/her of the trouble.
•	IF THE OFFICER TELLS YOU TO DO SO, contact Mike Favaloro (M12) on channel 1 or channel 3 (he could be on either) or via cell phone.
•	Create a call for the trouble alarm, including as many details from the alarm computer as possible and what action was taken.

Occasionally a trouble may come in and clear repeatedly. If the person you relieve warns you about a repeat trouble at shift change or if the officer tells you, you do not need to log the trouble every time it comes in. However, it can be helpful to keep track of how frequently a repeat trouble comes in on a piece of scrap paper to inform the officer or M12.

If a trouble clears from the system immediately after you acknowledge it (meaning it does not appear in the yellow Acknowledged Events field), there is no need to contact the duty officer.  An example of this is the 24 Hour Alarm (Trouble Restored Node101 T093) which comes in each day.  IF IN DOUBT, HOWEVER, ALWAYS CONTACT THE DUTY OFFICER.  Do contact them if this event occurs repeatedly in succession.

Some trouble alarms look differently than others.  Power related trouble alarms usually come in under the alarm type “Supervisory Alarm.”  Treat these as you would a trouble alarm except in one case:
•	A supervisory alarm that has the word “Security” in it for the Bennett Center is actually the Bennett  security alarm tripping.  For these alarms, you should call the Bennett front desk when Bennett is open (confirm with the cameras) both informing them of the alarm and ensuring that everything is OK.  When Bennett is closed, dispatch the officer to the security alarm at Bennett.
5.9a Recurring Trouble Alarms
When there are recurring troubles, there will be a PRINTED list on the cork board/dry erase board to the left of the Onyx fire computer monitor.  If you receive instruction from Mike Favaloro (Mobile 12) or an officer to add a new trouble, write it on the dry erase side with your initials and date.  These troubles will be added to the printed list on a regular basis, and will be sent to Mike regularly for updating.  You do NOT have to contact the duty officer any time these troubles come in.
5.9b Offline Buildings
Buildings will only be taken offline if Mike Favaloro (M12) or another alarm technician is working on the fire systems. Or if there is construction work in the building that has a high likely hood of tripping a false alarm. Whenever Mike or another alarm technician takes a building offline for service, he will attach a red laminated placard (stored behind the fire alarm monitor) to the top front of the alarm monitor as a visible reminder to all of us that a building is offline.  Mike may also call to instruct a member of Public Safety staff to hang the placard; we should NEVER display it unless directly asked to do so by Mike or his designee. When Mike has returned the building to normal function, he will either remove the placard (storing it again behind the monitor) or he will instruct us to remove it.

Anytime a building is taken offline for work or testing of any kind, it is important that you know why it is being taken offline.  There are two general cases and two responses to alarms that come in while a building is offline:
•	If the building is offline due to testing of the system or work by a fire alarm technician directly on the fire system where a fire alarm technician will be present and intentionally sending the building into alarm, you may ignore all alarms both trouble and fire that come in the system for that building while it is offline.
•	If the building is offline due to other construction work which we suspect may cause a false alarm (such as welding or sanding, or steam treating), you should dispatch the officer to any fire alarm that comes in for that building without tone and without notifying Regional.  This is because there is no fire system person on scene to determine if the alarm is legitimate or not.  The officer will simply confirm that the alarm was tripped due to the construction work as expected and report back to you.
      Whatever the reason, anytime a building is taken offline, you must log it and the reason on your log.  This log entry should be highlighted to remind you to pass on the information at shift change.  Similarly, you will log anytime a building is put back online and also highlight it.  Once the system goes live, you will also enter any fire system work into the fire system work section of the dispatch program main screen.

If you EVER see the red placard still displayed AFTER WORKING HOURS (1630-0800), you should immediately notify the duty officer who should IMMEDIATELY contact Mike.  NOTE: there are no exceptions to this, no matter how late it is and no matter whether or not you think the building may have been restored already, if the red placard is still displayed we will ALWAYS call Mike to confirm that everything is as it should be.  Only upon Mike’s instruction should the placard be removed and stored.

The text on the placard is as follows:

WARNING
If this notice is posted on the alarm monitor AFTER BUSINESS HOURS, notify the officer to contact Mike Favaloro IMMEDIATELY.
(A building was taken offline for service and has not been restored to normal function)

5.10   Panic Alarms
Through the Alertus system, which is the system we use to alert the campus to hazardous conditions or emergencies, we can also receive panic alarms from various locations across campus.  The system is tied into both the Alertus box that is located above the radio console as well as the secondary dispatch computer (top computer).
•	Various key locations across campus such as the Bennett Center, Library, Admission, etc. have panic buttons installed in discrete locations that act as a silent alarm of sorts.
•	Once these buttons are pressed, it initiates an alarm condition which will activate an Alertus screen with instructions on the dispatch computer, and audible alarm, and flashing red lights on the Alertus box.  The audible alarm will cycle through twice and the lights will continue flashing for longer.  If the audible alarm is problematic for your dispatch of the alarm, it can be acknowledged to silence the beep by pressing the two black buttons on the front simultaneously.
•	A panic alarm will come with two pieces of information, the location of the alarm and a call back number.  In most cases, this is the same place, but that is not always the case.  For instance, there is a button on the sound board desk in the chapel in the middle of the sanctuary, but the call back number is the lighting box on the third floor which has a bird’s eye view of the area.
•	When you receive a panic alarm, you should hit the general tone on the radio console and dispatch the following:
	“Control to all units, you are responding to a Panic Button activation at [location].  I will be calling [callback location], all responding units please acknowledge”
•	You should then call the callback number on the screen.  They may or may not answer.  If they answer and they are under duress and speaking frankly and honestly with you would put them at risk, they may answer your questions oddly.
•	Give any updated information you gather to the officer but be aware that they cannot “call off” the officer response, the officers will still go even if they say everything is all right.
•	These alarms will be tested weekly and you will be notified when they are tested.
•	All panic alarms that are not for testing should be entered as a new call in Report Exec and should generate a report. 
•	If you receive a panic alarm for the Bennett Center Pool, be aware that the wording on the alert is intended for the Bennett front desk staff and may sound weird to you. This particular alarm is dispatched as a medical for a potential drowing. You should dispatch the officer first, then call the Bennett front desk as the callback number. If the Bennett front desk answers, conference them with regional. If Bennett front desk does not pick up, call regional yourself.  
•	You will also receive through this same system, any alerts to the general campus that go to all campus owned computers, Alertus boxes in key strategic locations and announcement monitors (such as in lane and the library).  Examples are in the case of lock down, storm emergencies, school cancellation, security notices such as a dangerous person on campus…etc
•	You should be notified about these general campus alerts before they go out and you do not need to follow up on them unless instructed to do so.

6.5	RRC Backdoor and Mirror
________________________________________
Part of the roll of a dispatcher is to watch for suspicious or potentially hazardous activity around campus. While in the dispatch office you have access to the campus cameras and police scanner, and you can control a few of the gates and sometimes the door to RRC. You can, in effect, be in more than one place at a time by monitoring the cameras in addition to your other duties, so it is important to be aware of these things. Notify the officer of any suspicious persons or situations so that he or she can look into the situation. You will also receive calls from various parties requesting access to different locations on campus. It is your responsibility to gather all relevant information before radioing the officer with the request.

6.1	Lockouts and MasterPermission
These two admittance request items are handled in a similar manner. First, find the person’s name in Master Permission and verify that he or she has permission to access the location that he or she requested.
•	Lockouts
o	When a student is locked out of a residence hall or specific room, he or she will call Gordon Police if the RA or RD is unavailable. One of the first questions we should ask is whether or the student’s RA or RD is able to help, especially with room lockouts.  If no one else is able to help the student . . .
o	Find the student’s name using MasterPhone and confirm that he or she actually lives in the requested hall or room.
o	If the caller is a guest or a student who is a resident of a different hall, he or she will have to call the host/friend in the building to be let in. We cannot accommodate such requests.
o	If a student or staff member calls in regards to a door that is locked during a scheduled reservation, always verify it on the the master calander on 25 Live  If it is not on the report and there is no posted update or other printed note in the office ALWAYS radio the officer to confirm that there has not been any other emails, updates, or direct notifications to the officer of the reservation BEFORE instructing the caller that we cannot help them.
	If it is not on the report and if there was no update from Facilities Use and Space Planning, and the officer has no knowledge of any exceptions, inform the caller that we cannot open the space for him or her without authorization from Faciliteis Use and Space Planning that the space was officially reserved.
o	If you have verified the room reservation in 25 Live, notify the officer of the lockout request.
	NOTE: If the request is for a room in KOSC, CBMW or the Tavilla Conference Room, check with the ACDC if he or she is in office, as those areas can be opened automatically from Rodger.  Some residence hall exterior doors can also be opened automatically, though it is wiser to send the officer to tend to those requests in person since they pertain to residential living space.
•	MasterPermission
o	If a student requests access to a locked space on campus, confirm that he or she has permission using the MasterPermission database.
	Pay attention to any time and date restrictions that may be placed on the student.
	Verify that the caller is already AT the location that he or she wishes to be admitted to.  Officers will not accept an admit request if the caller is asking something like, “Can the officer let me into [area] in 15 or 20 minutes?”
o	We cannot let students in to locked areas without prior permission from a professor or supervisor of some kind.
o	If the name is not found in MasterPermission, the officer may have you ask the student to have his or her professor/supervisor call or email police@gordon.edu to receive permission.  However, for regular access we must have permission on file in our office.
o	At no time, should you give a yes or no response for an access request without FIRST radioing the officer, there always may be extenuating circumstances or arrangements that you have not been apprised of.
With both types of admits, ask the person calling to call us back if they gain access before the officer arrives. This will prevent the officer from wasting time going to needless requests. All admittance requests should be entered on your dispatch log (appropriately note whether the person was admitted or denied).
6.1a Access Control (Key Cards)
The access control system includes all Gordon issued key cards and automatic door locks.  Dispatchers are never required to know how to manage the access control system, but it is helpful to know how to handle calls or requests for access control needs.
Card Access
All students who have card access to areas on campus other than their residential rooms (ie. Labs) should also be listed in the MasterPermission database.  If a student or staff member calls or comes into the office with an issue regarding card access, the ACDC will address it.  However, if the ACDC is not present, please get the following information:
•	Name of individual.
•	Description of the problem.
o	If the problem is related to proximity doors (KOSC, CBMW & Bromley & Chase entrances), please acquire the “prox” number (see graphic).
o	This number is located on the rear of the ID card along the very bottom edge.  The prox number is the first 5 digits of the long number string.  Cards do not need to be encoded for prox access.
o	If the problem is related to the card swipe doors (Chase, Tavilla, Fulton, Nyland, etc.), advise the individual to see Auxiliary Services between the hours of 0800 and 1630, but please get a detailed description of the problem.
•	If the person requesting card access is a student, inform him or her that we need authorization from a professor or departmental authority before setting up card access.  Dispatchers can double check the Master Permissions database to verify whether or not we have already received such authorization.
•	Please give all of the aforementioned information to the ACDC in an email.
•	You may also feel free to give the ACDC’s business card (located on the windowsill near the service counter) which includes the ACDC’s extension for voicemail and email address for problems that seem complicated.
•	If a student comes into the office for a replacement or damaged ID card, inform them that CTS handles ID card replacement. 
•	Please note that there are several areas on campus that function on automatic door schedules.  These are always programmed by the ACDC.  However, if someone calls or comes into the office claiming that a scheduled door (such as in Ken Olsen or a Chase classroom) is locked, treat the situation like a normal admit request.  After the request is dispatched please send the ACDC the details of the problem.  Again, these room reservations should be on 25 Live, though sometimes things slip through the cracks.  No matter the reason, the ACDC should be alerted that a problem occurred.

6.2	The Gates
We monitor two gates from the office: the main gate outside the dispatch window and the Woodland lot gate. When the gates are down, the main gate is the only legal access to the campus, so anyone coming to the college should pass by us. A dispatcher will never deny a person entry to campus. However, if you ever think that something is not right with a situation and/or you feel that someone is giving you false information/should not be on campus, notify the officer of the situation and give a good description of the vehicle. If possible, try to stall the suspicious party before letting them in to allow the officer to find them.

6.2a Main Gate
The Main Gate is to be closed by the dispatcher whenever the officer secures the BCA Gate at night (around 2200) and is to be raised when the BCA gate is opened or at 0600, whichever comes first.
•	Most people pass through the main gate at night.
•	A button on the dispatch console manually manages the main gate (bottom button on right side of console, underneath “remote gate”).
o	We always put the gate down between each car with no exceptions (even for the cruiser).
o	If a car hits the gate, fails to stop for it, or sneaks in with another car, you should radio the officer immediately to let him or her know.
	Include as much information as possible about the vehicle/situation so that the vehicle operator can be tracked down.
Main Gate Protocol
•	As a car approaches the gate, you should look on the windshield for a current parking permit or on the dash for a current temporary pass.
o	If the vehicle has a temporary pass, be sure to check the expiration date.
o	Faculty and staff members who have been around for a number of years may still have a square gold sticker in the rear driver’s side window, so keep an eye out for that as well.
o	If the vehicle has a current sticker or pass, you can raise the gate.
•	If the vehicle does not have a current sticker or pass, use the intercom and ask the driver if he or she is a current student.  You should ask this of every person entering no matter their apparent age. If you feel uncomfortable asking just if they are a student and they are obviously older, you can ask if they are a student or a staff member. Remember that we do have a growing and thriving graduate program that people of all ages enroll in.
o	If the driver responds that he or she is just dropping someone off or that the car will not be on campus over night, you must still confirm whether or not he or she is a student or staff member. Commuters will often try to avoid registering their car in this way (even though they are automatically billed for a commuter pass).
•	If the driver is a student, ask why the vehicle is not registered.  If the driver is a staff member, have him or her come inside and register (FREE registration for all staff and faculty).
o	If the driver has not had time to register yet, tell him or her to come in and register the vehicle immediately. It only takes a few minutes.
o	If the student refuses, you may let him or her through, but you should let the student know that he or she is at risk of receiving a citation.  You should then give the vehicle information to the officer on duty and the possible location that the student is headed.
o	If the student is waiting on information for registration, or is borrowing the car, have him or her come inside to get a temporary parking pass for $20 or risk a citation for $25 or $60 for excessive violations.
	Students who are borrowing a vehicle, but already have a different vehicle registered for the current school year, do not need to pay for the temporary pass.  The normal registration fee covers it.
•	If the person is not a student or staff member, you should ask them what his or her purpose on campus is.
o	If he or she is staying over night, a 3-day visitor pass is necessary. These passes are free for visitors (see section 10.2).
o	If the visitor is just dropping off/picking up, confirm the name and location of the person he or she is visiting/dropping off in the computer before you open the gate
6.2b Woodland Gate
The Woodland lot gate is closed automatically from 1800-0600 nightly.
•	Gordon community members can swipe an ID card to open the gate.
•	We have the ability to raise the gate for one car at a time to pass through.
•	This gate will automatically lower behind each car, so if a second car follows, the gate may come down on it.
Woodland Gate Protocol
•	If someone calls the intercom (black and gray pohone behind the police line), ask the driver if he or she is a current student.
•	If the driver claims to be a student, verify by asking for his or her name and ID number and confirming this information in the computer.
•	If he or she is not a student, ask for his or her reason for being on campus. As with the main gate, verify any information about who/where he or she is visiting in the computer before letting them in.
•	If you believe that the person should not be on campus or that the person is giving you false information, stall them and notify the officer before opening the gate.  Once you open the gate, monitor the vehicle using the cameras and relay any relevant information to the officer, such as location and any suspicious activity.

6.3	Cameras
Keep an eye on the cameras as much as possible during your shift. This does not mean constantly watching them, but keeping them in your peripheral vision and glancing at them frequently.  If you notice anything suspicious on the cameras during your shift, write down any relevant information on your scratch pad and radio the officer.  It is a good idea to also record the time in case you need to log the information later.

Using the Cameras
•	There are four camera monitors controlled by two seperate computers. They share a keyboard and mouse, so you must use the black switch-box on the desk to choose which one to operate. 
•	These computers are designated for camerera monitoring ONLY. They should never be used for any other purpose.
•	You can make a camera full screen by selecting it from the dropdown menu on the left of the screen.
•	When a camera is selected in full screen, you can use the controls in the bottom left of the screen to manuever, focus, zoom, etc. 
o	Note: Only some cameras have the ability to move.
o	Do NOT unnecessarily move cameras. Some are positioned for specific reasons. If you beleieve a camera should be moved, ask an officer or the ACDC if it should be where it is or if it should be positioned differently.
o	If you do move a camera, unless instructed otherwise, return it to its normal home setting. 
o	If you need to operate a camera for an extended period of time, it can be helpful to close the other window on the same computer. This can help to keep the computer from responding slowly while you try to manuever a camera. 
•	To go back to the standard view, select the appropriately labeled layout (1A, 1B, 2A, or 2B). 
o	Be aware that there is a camera in our office. We do not monitor it, but you can pull it up from the menu. There is also a camara in KOSC 036 that we do not monitor, but only the officers and the ACDC have access to it. 
•	Avoid moving cameras if not neccessary. Some will reset themselves to a default angle, but some will NOT. 
Recorded Files 
•	You can access camera recordings from the camera computers by selecting the camera from the menu on the left and then expanding it by pressing the plus sign next to it. Select the day you want and select a time (times reflect the beginning of that recording).
•	You can use the controls to fast forward, pause, etc. 
•	To reset, select the appropriately labeled layout from the menu on the left. 
Logging In
•	It may sometimes be neccessary to log back into the camera program (passwords can be found on a note in the drawer to your left).
•	To do this, select Sentry VMS (or Monitor Station) from the lower monitor on either computer. You will have to do this four times, once for each monitor.
•	Make sure each layout is correctly matching form the menu on the left of the screen and the label on each monitor (1A, 1B, 2A, 2B).
If cameras go down
•	Cameras often go down on the computer. They will turn gray and we will get no feed from them. Sometimes it is a glitch in the system and will come back up quickly (the cameras at 216 Grapevine sometimes do this). Other times it is permanent and needs to be fixed. 
o	Note: If a camera appears black, look more closely. It is probably just dark where the camera is pointed. When a camera goes down, the screen will be obviously all gray. 
•	If at any point a camera feed goes gray on the computer screen, wait a moment. If it does not come back up in a minute or two, close that window and log back in. If it is still down, notify the officer which camera is not functioning. If it is still down by the end of your shift, send an email to CTS from the dispatch email letting them know which camera is down and when it went down.
•	If all the cameras go down at once. Immediately let the officer know that all the cameras are currently down. Try restarting the program. If this does not fix the problem call CTS (or email if it is not during business hours).
o	The exeption is if there is a scheduled network outage. You should be notified prior to or at the beginning of your shift if this is going to happen. If this is the case, you can ignore the cameras going down. 
•	If the camera for the Cashier's office goes down, immediately notify the officer and follow the same steps to try and fix it. This is because a lot of money is handled through this office and it is important for security reasons to have the cameras up. 
Confidentiality
•	As with all other things in the office, what is seen on the cameras is to be kept confidential and only shared with other members of the department on a need to know basis. 
•	At no time should you be using your phone (or other device) to take pictures or video of what is on a camera feed (including if you see a close friend on one of the cameras). 
•	Capturing images of people on the camera system is an invasion of privacy and is a serious offense. 

6.4	Scanner
Speakers for our radio scanner are on the window sill behind the dispatch computer. We monitor several local channels but the most important are the Wenham PD and FD channels. You are permitted to turn down the volume on scanner during high traffic times (meaning multiple stations are talking as is GCPD) if it is distracting you from listening to the Gordon radio. However it is NEVER all right to turn the volume all the way down. The scanner should also be audible over any movies, games, or music you are listening to while in the office. Monitoring the scanner may seem pointless, but Wenham may try to contact us over the radio or you may hear about an incident near the campus (i.e. Grapevine Rd., Parsons Hill, or Iron Rail) that you or the officer should be aware of. It is also possible in a world of cell phones that there is an emergency called in to 911 by a cell phone on campus that the officer will need to respond to.
Any time you overhear anything on the scanner that the officer should be aware of, radio him/her to make sure they heard it as well.  This includes BOLOs (Be On the Look Out).

6.5	RRC Back Doors and Mirror
At night and on windy days the back door to the office door is sometimes locked by the officer.  People will buzz the door for access.  You can let them in by pressing and holding the “Rodger Door” button above the gate buttons on the dispatch console. Occasionally, people will think the door is locked when it is not and will buzz in accordingly. Motion them to come in the door.   If it is late at night and the door has not been locked and you would feel more comfortable if it were, radio the officer and (s)he will lock it for you.

The convex mirror in the office will allow you to see the customer service counter from the back of the office. However, it is most useful when you are sitting in front of the computer; you can view the desk, hallway, and back door without having to turn around. Check the hallway when you hear the back door open. If an unauthorized party goes upstairs, notify the officer immediately.

________________________________________
7.1	The Nature of the Dispatch Log
The dispatch log is an important part of your job as dispatcher. Dispatch logs are a public record and a legal document that can be called into court if needed as evidence. Please bear in mind:  It is important that your log is always clear, legible, accurate, and complete.

7.2	Keeping Your Log
•	Your log should always have your full name, the date, and the shift you are working written at the top.
•	The rest of your log should be an accurate and complete list of the events happening on your shift in chronological order.  Always use military time.
o	The very first entry and the very last entry will be relief times.
	These times should match the person you relieve and your relief. Log the relief time by entering it in the “time” column and then, ignoring the fields, writing ‘relieved’ and the name of the person you are relieving. Similarly, at the end of your shift, you will write ‘relieved by’ and then the full name of the dispatcher relieving you. Do not use a person’s nickname.
•	Each entry should always include:
o	The name of the person making the request.
o	The caller’s location or the location of the request.
o	A brief (but complete) description of the request or situation.
o	The officer or person responding in the disposition column followed by a slash (/) and then their clear time(s).
•	Any information that you write should always match up with other records, other logs, and the officers’ logs.
•	In the case of multiple things happening at once or complex events such as emergency situations, use the scratch pad to take notes and fill out the log when the situation is over.
•	The best abbreviation methods are the “10” codes listed on the first page of the at-hand information binder.  You should learn the majority of these codes before your first shift.

7.3	Items That Should Be Logged
If you are ever unsure of whether something should be logged or not, you can ask the officer on duty. If he or she is unsure, log it and contact the ACDC or Lt. and ask them to clarify.  These common situations are always logged:
•	As a general rule, log anything that the officer does. Usually, log entries will have a corresponding 10 code.
•	Any request of the officer to do something that comes in by phone or radio.
•	Buildings being checked, secured, or opened: Log time and 10 code. Disposition not necessary if the officer is simply reporting that the area or building has been checked, secured or opened.
•	Motor vehicle stops: Log location, vehicle involved, infraction, any other pertinent info given by officer.
•	Vehicle tows (dispatch log and separate tow log): Log vehicle involved, towed from and to.
•	Escorts (dispatch log and separate escort log): Log time of original call, name of caller, from and to, arrival time, clear time.
•	Trouble alarms: Log location of alarm, info from ONXY screen, the action taken.
•	Any phone calls that the officer asks you to make (for example a call to a student to move their car from a fire lane): Log a brief description of what was said, (i.e. left message, indicated car would be ticketed/towed if not moved in next 15 min).
•	Any complaint or report someone makes of an observation that pertains to the department: Log details and notify officer.
•	All admittance requests:  Log name of person, area of admittance, whether access was granted or denied.
•	Anything else the officer asks you to log.

________________________________________
8.1	Work Request Items
Physical Plant
Work orders for Physical Plant are handled online. When the officer requests you to fill out a work request for Physical Plant:
•	Sign on to the GO! Site.
•	Click on “Departments.”
•	Click on “Physical Plant.”
•	Select “Work requests.”
•	Click “Enter a new request.”
•	Scroll to the bottom of the drop down list to select “Police.”  - if you do not see a drop down list here, notify the ACDC so that your access level in the system can be adjusted.
•	Enter 4444 as the phone number and Police as the department.
•	Fill in any information provided by the officer.   As much as possible, entries should be word for word descriptions as provided by the officer.  If you are unsure of the wording, read it back to the officer before submitting.
•	Click “Submit.”
CTS
Work orders for CTS usually only fall under the category of major network emergencies or outages or problems with campus phones or our cameras.  We do not have to enter work orders for individuals who call us with network problems.  They can be connected directly to CTS (x4500).

Dispatchers may enter CTS work requests for issues involving campus phones and technology if instructed by the officer (as with Physical Plant work orders), which can be done by emailing CTS@gordon.edu.  Always use the dispatch email function for these emails so that they are sent from the police@gordon.edu email address rather than your personal email address.

8.2	Escort Log (App. Escort Log)
In the event of an escort, you need to log the information in Report Exec. In Report Exec use "Assistance: Escort" as the call type. Make sure to include the time that the call came in, the name of the person requesting the escort, where he or she is going (from and to), the officer responding, his or her arrival time, and his or her clear time.

8.3	Tow Log & Bike Confiscations (App. Tow Log)
MV Tows
In the event of a vehicle tow, record the information in both the tow log and Report Exec.  The tow log is kept in a binder to the right of the dispatch console.  If someone comes to us saying his or her vehicle has disappeared, before treating it as a stolen item, check the logs see if it was towed.  If the vehicle has been towed, inform the party where his or her vehicle has been moved (usually the Woodland lot).  The owner will have been cited for the parking violation as well as the towing fee.
Bike Confiscations
If the officer radios you with a bike confiscation, you will need to record the bike confiscation in MasterBike and in Report Exec.
•	Click “MasterBike” and “Enter a New Confiscation”.
•	Ask the officer if the bike has a sticker.
•	Fill out the form with the details provided by the officer.  If the officer does not give them to you, ask for the make, model, color, location found, serial number and reason confiscated.
•	Give the officer the confiscation number.
If a student comes into the office claiming his or her bike has been stolen or lost, check the bike confiscation list in MasterBike before reporting it as stolen.  There is usually a $15 punitive fine for the retrieval of a confiscated bike. To retrieve a bike, the party must take a Confiscated Bike Slip to the Cashier's window in MacDonald and bring back a reciept or pay the fine on CashNet. After ownership is verified and the fee is paid, an officer can take the owner to the confiscation area to retrieve his or her bike.
•	If the individual believes they should be exempt from the $15 fine, they should be directed to speak with the officer.

8.4	Absentee Parking Passes (App. Green Pass and Waiver Form)
During the summer, students who will be off campus for any length of time and will be leaving their cars here will need to obtain an absentee parking pass.  They are required to fill out an application for absentee parking and assumption of risk with the vehicle’s information as well as the time period that they plan on being away from campus.  Dispatchers fill out a green Absentee Parking Pass to be placed on the dashboard of the car, with the vehicle information.  An officer or the ACDC needs to sign both forms before the pass is valid.  These cars are typically parked in lot G or H.  During the summer, these forms are kept in a folder near the citation petition forms next to the lost and found cabinet.

8.5	Missing/Added/Changed Information Log
Anytime that you are notified of updated or incorect information that you are not able to correct, there is a log to the right of the dispatch desk where this can be logged for data entry. This could include incorrect information in MasterFiles or any updated information that we are notified about (vehicle plates, cell phone numbers, vehicle descriptions, etc.). This log will be checked regularly by senior dispatch staff. Be sure to intitial and each entry in case there are follow up or clarification questions.

________________________________________
9.1	Shift Length
During the school year shifts are typically 2 hours long during business hours and 4 hours long outside of the business day.  Some experienced dispatchers will work 8-hour shifts but these are unusual.  During scheduled campus breaks (i.e. summer) shifts will usually be 8 hours long.  The shift cycle usually starts at 0400 (i.e. 0400-1200, 1200-2000, 2000-0400) for breaks, and is always noted in military time.

9.2	Desk Coverage and Breaks
During your shift you should remain at the dispatch station AT ALL TIMES.  At no time should you go past the front counter without proper substitute coverage at the desk.
The following policies apply to breaks:
•	You are entitled to a 15-minute bathroom break during a 4-hour shift and two 15-minute breaks during an 8-hour shift.
•	Only currently employed dispatchers and officers are capable of covering you for a break.
•	You must have desk coverage for all breaks (including bathroom breaks or anything requiring you to leave the desk area), so breaks are dependent upon the availability of an officer or dispatcher to cover for you.
•	It is good to notify the officer well in advance if you need to take a bathroom break, rather than waiting until the very last moment as it may take time for them to return to the office.
•	To request a break, radio the officer and request a “10-19D” (for a dispatcher break).
While you are on a break:
•	You must take a radio with you and obtain permission of the officer if you leave the office.
•	You may not leave campus.
•	If the officer notifies you via radio that an emergency call has come in while you are on break, you must drop whatever you are doing and immediately return to the office as quickly as possible.
Because we are an emergency response center, we cannot reiterate enough the importance of never leaving the desk for any length of time.  Please do not abuse your privilege to take a short break.

9.3	Beginning a Shift
You are expected to come in at least 10 minutes before your shift begins so that you are completely ready to take over on the hour. As you begin your shift, you should:
•	Note which officer is on duty from the dispatcher you are relieving as well as any relevant information and ongoing situations.
•	Check the fire computers to see any existing troubles and their locations so you can recognize a new trouble should one come in.
•	Log into your email to check for any new anouncements or shift coverage requests.
•	Check for any new notices in the at hand information folder, on the bulletin board, the tack strip, or the white board.
•	Check the counter to see if there is anything waiting to be picked up and make sure you understand who will collect the item and when.  Ensure there is a properly initialed, timed, and dated note on the item indicating all of the above. Additionally make sure the person has been notified that the item is in the office by either phone or email.
•	Log into Report Exec and put yourself on duty as "dispatch."
•	Log into MasterFiles and the Go! site on the general use computer. 
•	Officially relieve the dispatcher on duty.

9.4	Ending a Shift
Before you leave at the end of your shift, be sure you have done the following:
•	Brief the relieving dispatcher of all information he or she needs for his or her shift including the current officer on duty.
•	Notify the relieving dispatcher of anything that you know they can expect to happen during their shift.
•	Point out any new notices or notes and explain them.
•	Ensure that any item left in the office from your shift has a note attached to it fully explaining its purpose there with your initials, the date and time.
•	Fill out your timesheet.

9.5	Time Sheets and Time Paid (App. Timesheet)
It is college policy that student workers are paid in 1/4-hour increments, with shift start and end times rounded to the nearest quarter hour.  If everyone is on time, this is easy.  When someone is relieved late, it must be done this way:
•	Timesheets can be found on the Go! site under "Student Links"
•	Round the time that the relief officially occurred to the nearest quarter hour.
•	For example: If you relieve Joe Dispatcher at 1205, this is closer to 1200 than 1215, so you begin being paid at 1200. Your time sheet should indicate being on at 1200 and Joe’s sheet should indicate being off at 1200.  If, however, you relieve Joe at 1208, this is closer to 1215. Your timesheet must indicate work starting at 1215 and Joe gets the extra 15 minutes of pay.
o	DO NOT abuse the system by continuously being 5-7 minutes late and taking the quarter hour of pay.  This is dishonest and unfair to the dispatcher whom you are relieving.  Shift changes are emailed to the ACDC and the officers, so they will be able to note who is continuously late. Repetitive tardiness will not be tolerated and can be grounds for termination.
•	It is NOT acceptable for both dispatchers to take the 15-minute increment. You must figure out the proper rounding and agree together who will mark the extra 15 minutes on the time sheet.
•	The ONLY instance when both dispatchers may be paid for the same time is when an emergency is ongoing at the scheduled shift change time. The incoming dispatcher should begin being paid at the normal shift change time; the outgoing dispatcher should be paid to the nearest 15-minute increment when the emergency ends and he or she actually leaves. In such cases, the dispatcher taking the extra pay should mark the time sheet entry with an asterisk and note that there was an emergency at the bottom of the time sheet (see section 9.6). An email should be sent to the ACDC alerting that this has occurred.
•	If you arrive 15 minutes early, you are NOT paid for this time.  The earliest you can begin being paid is the start of your normal shift time (unless you actually arranged ahead of time to cover a part of the shift for another dispatcher).

9.6	Emergencies at Shift Change
If an emergency call comes in near the end of your shift and it is still going on when your relief arrives, it is expected that you will stay to finish the emergency before being relieved.  Mistakes are easily made when dispatchers switch in the middle of an emergency.

If you feel that it is the type of situation that might continue for an extended period of time (over 30 minutes), you may request the officer to authorize your relief and departure and then note that it was authorized and who authorized it in the Rerort Exec call.  Be sure that your relief in this situation is FULLY AND COMPLETELY briefed on all of the details of the situation.
•	NOTE: This is the only instance where it is acceptable for both dispatchers to take the same time increment on their time sheets (see section 9.5).

9.7	Late Relief
If your relief is late for his or her shift:
•	Check the dispatch schedule on the bulletin board.
•	Once it is officially time for shift change (i.e. 0800, 1200, etc.), you may call the scheduled dispatcher. The dispatcher call list is located in the the at-hand binder and all numbers are on speed-dial in the operator phone. 
•	If you are unable to reach him or her, notify the officer on duty (it is possible that the officer may be able to knock on the dispatcher’s room door if they live on campus).
•	If this is not effective, notify the ACDC and Head Dispatcher of the situation and follow the procedure for finding emergency shift coverage (i.e. call down the dispatcher list).
•	It is imperative that ANY TIME a dispatcher fails to show up for a shift or is excessively late, you email the ACDC to alert them of what occurred.  This is regardless of whether coverage was found, or you are willing to stay on.
NOTE: If you are going to be late for a shift (even if it is only a minute or two), as early as possible call the office to let the dispatcher on duty know of the situation. This way they can plan ahead and find coverage for that time if they need to get to class or another commitment. Repeated tardiness for scheduled shifts is grounds for dismissal. If you are having trouble making it on time for a certain shift due to a class or other event that happens just before your shift, speak to the ACDC immediately, so that the conflict can be resolved.

9.8	Emergency Shift Coverage
If you receive a call from your relief who is unable to work due to illness, death in the family, or a similar emergency:
•	Immediately notify the ACDC (or the Head Dispatcher if the ACDC is unable to be reached). If you are willing and able to cover the shift, let the ACDC know this when you call.  If not, give an estimate of how long you are able to stay.
•	The dispatcher taking the call should also email dps-students@gordon.edu as soon as possible looking for coverage.
•	Once a supervisor has been notified, you should begin calling down the sub list to find a replacement (this must be done right away, no matter what time it is). Texting is also a helpful supplemental mode of reaching the coverage list but does not replace calling down the list with phone calls (leaving voicemails).
•	If coverage is found or not, update the ACDC on coverage progress.  If the ACDC was not reached but you worked with the Head Dispatcher to find a solution, email the ACDC a summary of what transpired.

NOTE: If for any reason you need to get a shift covered at the last minute for an EMERGENCY (such as illness or a death in the family), contact the ACDC by phone.  Let him or her know the specifics of the situation and he or she will instruct you as to what to do.  If for any reason you are unable to get in contact with the ACDC, you should try to contact the Head Dispatcher or Lieutenant. Do not wait until the last minute to call if you know you have an emergency.

9.9	Shift Coverage and Substitutions
There must always be someone working at the dispatch desk (24/7/365). You are responsible for your scheduled shift for the duration of the semester.  This includes school vacation days such as MLK Jr. Day, Quad Break and Easter break.  Longer breaks (Christmas, Thanksgiving and spring break) are handled via a special schedule.

You are responsible for filling your shift if you cannot work.  Because of the requirement that the desk be covered at all times, failure to cover a scheduled shift or to follow proper shift change procedure is a serious issue and may be grounds for dismissal.

9.10	Shift Coverage Procedure 
When you wish to have a shift covered, you must EMAIL the entire dispatch staff including the ACDC by using the email dps-students@gordon.edu. The email must contain the following:
•	A detailed description of the shift you want coverage for (date, time, brief reason for why you want coverage).
•	If you feel as though it is mandatory you have the requested shift covered, please email the ACDC explaining your reasons at least 2 weeks in advance.
•	When multiple dispatchers reply saying they would like to cover a shift, the general rule is first one to respond gets it. 
•	When a shift is exchanged either the dispatcher giving the shift or the one taking it should cross their name of the shift on the schedule in the back of the office and write the new name in. If they cannot come into the office, they should call and ask the dispatcher on duty to do so for them. 
The following policies for shift changes apply:
•	There is NEVER a time when someone else covers your shift and a shift coverage email is not required.  Even if you have a sub arranged from the start, notification must be posted (both on the schedule and an email to ACDC copying all parties involved in the swap).
•	If you arrange coverage and it is not written in on the schedule or in an email to the ACDC, and a dispatcher does not show up, it will be your responsibility.  If it’s not in writing, it is still your shift.
•	You must send a shift coverage email request at least 2 weeks in advance of a shift if you feel that it is mandatory that you have it off (see section 9.11).
•	For non-mandatory shift changes, you may send an email within 1 week in advance, as you will be covering the shift anyway if no sub is found.
•	If no one takes your shift after a period of time, begin to call down the list of dispatchers to secure coverage.  You will generally receive better coverage for your shifts if you are willing to help others out when they need to get shifts covered.
•	Please check your email for open shifts at the beginning of your shift and take whichever shifts you can.
•	If you choose to take an open shift, please reply all to the email so everyone knows it is covered and either change the name on the shift in the office yourself or call the dispatcher working to do it for you.
o	Reminder: You are required to check your email at least once every 24 hours to check for new announcenets and coverage requests. You should respond in some manner to all departmental emails (even if just to say "got it") (see section 2.4).

9.11	Mandatory Shift Coverage Requests
To request a mandatory shift change, follow the same procedure as above.  Note in your email that you believe that it is mandatory to have the shift covered.  The ACDC will approve or deny whether or not the coverage is mandatory.
•	Reminder:  MANDATORY REQUESTS SHOULD BE POSTED AT LEAST TWO WEEKS BEFORE COVERAGE IS NEEDED. AND AN EMAIL TO THE ACDC STATING THE SITUATION IS REQUIRED.
•	YOU are responsible for checking on the status (you should not assume it will be approved).
If the request for a mandatory shift change is approved, you must do the following:
•	You are still responsible for finding a replacement.  Be proactive and call down the list to find someone.
•	If you have not found someone by TWO DAYS prior to the shift, you must notify the ACDC.
•	Continue to try to fill the shift. 24 HOURS in advance, you must notify a supervisor that the shift is still open. At this point, you may cease attempts to fill the shift; the ACDC will arrange coverage.

If the shift change request was NOT mandatory, or if the request for mandatory was denied, you must work the shift if you were unable to secure substitute coverage.

Examples of acceptable mandatory shift changes are weddings, funerals, finals occurring during your shift, illnesses, surgeries, a play that you are in, etc.

Examples of non-mandatory shift changes are your birthday, going on a date, seeing a play that your friend is in, going home for the weekend, personal travel/trip, company (family/friends) coming, etc.

10.1	Motor Vehicle Registration. (App. Gordon Registration Form, Nonresident Driver Form)
General Information
All persons who register a vehicle with us should have their state registration form, drivers license and proof of insurance (same form for MA residents) with them while registering.  This ensures that they are recording the correct information on our Gordon registration card.  Nonresidents of MA will NEED their registration and proof of insurance documents in order to complete the nonresident permit application (see section 10.1b). They must also provide a cell phone number in the event that we need to contact them for moving their vehicle.  If the registrant claims to not have a cell phone, he or she must fill out the appropriate cell-phone notice slip.

Our main goal in registering a student is to give them a Gordon permit as soon as possible.  The MA nonresident form is a COMPLTELY SEPARATE process.  Issuing a Gordon College permit is in no way contingent upon issuing a nonresident permit at the time of registration.  However, students should ALWAYS be handed a written warning about the penalty for NOT obtaining a nonresident sticker.  Non-Massachusetts resident students should make it a priority to obtain their nonresident permit.

Registration Procedures
10.1a Gordon Registration Form
When filling out a Gordon registration form, the following information is REQUIRED for all registrants:


Keep in mind that since the registrant should have his or her state vehicle registration and insurance information, the entire form can and should be filled out.  However, the REQUIRED information highlighted above indicates the information that we must have in order to accept a registration form.  For example, you should never turn someone away from registering simply because he or she does not know his or her Gordon ID, license number, etc.

If the registrant does not have his or her registration and proof of insurance in hand, it must be retrieved from the vehicle before beginning the registration procedure.  This is for our own good because we can then verify the information is accurate.  If REQUIRED information is completely unavailable (i.e. registration or plates have not been mailed to him/her from the state), you can then issue a 24-Hour Administrative Pass (see section 10.3).  Remember, the minimum information required to issue a Gordon sticker is highlighted above and also on a laminated sheet near the front counter.

If registrants are missing NON-REQUIRED information, you can proceed with completing the registration and issue the appropriate Gordon sticker.  He or she should then be instructed to email the missing information to Public Safety at their earliest convenience so that we can eventually have the information on file.

10.1b Nonresident Driver Statement
All nonresident students of Massachusetts must obtain a nonresident permit (explanation on form).  THE NONRESIDENT PERMIT FORM IS A COMPLETELY SEPARATE PROCESS FROM THE GORDON VEHICLE REGISTRATION PROCESS.  In other words, students should always be issued a Gordon College permit (see section 10.1a) even if they cannot complete the nonresident form at the time of registration.  The nonresident permit should only be issued to full time undergraduate students (this does not apply to faculty or staff).  The nonresident permit has nothing to do with whether the student lives on campus or commutes and applies even to students who commute from out of state.  The nonresident permit should only be issued to students whose vehicle has an out of state plate.
Notes about nonresident permit:
•	The sticker is free of charge.
•	If a student cannot complete the nonresident form at time of registration, issue a nonresident disclaimer notice with the nonresident form and instruct the student to COMPLETELY fill out the form and return it to Public Safety in order to obtain a nonresident sticker.  Tell all students that we cannot accept incomplete nonresident forms.
•	The nonresident permit application must be COMPLETELY filled out before we can issue a nonresident permit. If nonresident information is unavailable, you can still issue a Gordon College sticker, but you CANNOT issue a nonresident permit.
•	Please do all that you can to assist students in filling out the nonresident form.  Common areas of confusion:
o	REGISTRATION NUMBER = License plate.
o	Insurance Information:  This must be accurate and up to date.  Students should have their proof of insurance with them, so the information should be at hand.  If they have questions about their coverage, they should confirm with their agent or their parent/guardian.  As this is a legally binding document, NEVER encourage someone to guess or assure them that it is probably ok.
o	The document MUST be signed.
o	We legally cannot issue a permit to someone who checks “no” for either insurance question.  Their insurance must meet the Massachusetts required minimum no matter what their residential state minimum is.  If the answer is no to either of the questions, send them with the form and tell them to come back once their coverage has been adjusted to the legal minimum and then a sticker may be issued.

10.1c Registration Notes
Questions to ask every registrant:
•	Do you have your registration and proof of insurance?
•	Are you a Graduate student, Undergraduate student, Faculty, or Staff?
•	Does the vehicle have Massachusetts’ plates?
•	Are you a commuter or a resident?
•	Have you had a vehicle on campus before?

Frequently asked questions from registrants:
Q:  What if I am only going to have this car on campus temporarily?
A:  If the car is only going to be on campus for less than 2 weeks, we can issue a temporary pass.  The charge for a temporary pass is $5 - - any longer than 2 weeks, and you should register the vehicle for the year.  If you happen to then remove the vehicle from campus, email Public Safety for a fee reduction.

Q:  Can I register two cars on campus?
A:  Yes, you may register two cars, however, you can only have one car on campus at a time.  You will only be charged for one vehicle.

Q:  I’m going abroad in the spring. Can I only be charged for a semester fee instead of a whole year?
A:  We have to record a full-year fee for all students, but if you are definitely going abroad, send an email to Public Safety at the end of the semester and your fee will be reduced to the semester rate at that time.

Q:  Where can I park without getting a ticket?
A:  All of the parking restrictions are listed on the Go site and posted here in our office on the bulletin boards.

Any question that you cannot answer can always be directed to the duty officer or sent in an email to Public Safety from the student.

Other Registration Notes
•	Always record the full-year fee (unless otherwise instructed).  Fees are not always the same from year to year.
•	Students who believe they qualify for a fee reduction should email Public Safety.
•	Gordon stickers go in the lower left hand side front windshield.
•	Nonresident stickers go in top center of the front windshield, just beneath the rear-view mirror.
•	Dependents of Faculty/Staff are charged zero “0” fee.
•	Public Safety does not receive student payments in the office.  The fee will be charged to his or her student bill.  However, if he or she wishes to pay it right away, he or she can take the money to the cashier’s window in Frost. WE NEVER ACCEPT PAYMENT IN THE OFFICE.
•	First year students must park in Woodland.  Clarify what year the student is so that they receive a Woodland sticker, if necessary.  There is provided a list of first year students in the office with which you can verify.  Woodland stickers are determined by years at Gordon, not by credit standing.
•	First-year students who commute are not restricted to Woodland.
•	All commuters are billed automatically for the full year fee.  Therefore, there is no financial gain for a commuter student to delay registration.
•	Check all registration forms for legibility and clarity.  We need to be able to read them with NO confusion!  Watch out for 5’s and S’s, 4’s and 9’s, 6’s and G’s, zeroes and O’s and 2’s and Z’s and 1’s and I’s! (it is common practice to cross a zero to differentiate from O’s and cross Zs to differentiate from 2s)
•	Initial and date registration cards.
•	All registrants must provide a cell phone number.  If they do not own cell phones, they must sign the “Cell Phone Notice” underneath the front counter.

10.1d Special Registrations
When a graduate student comes in to register:
•	Have the grad student fill out only the Gordon registration card.  Nonresident form not required.
•	Double-check the information by referencing the person’s state registration form.
•	Issue a graduate sticker and record the number on the Gordon registration card.
•	Check the “Graduate Student” box.
•	Record zero “0” fee.  They pay for parking as part of their “graduate fee” on their student bill.
•	Initial and date the form.
Motorcycles are registered in the following manner:
•	Have the individual fill out the Gordon registration card.
•	Nonresident permit rules apply (undergrad students only).
•	Double-check the information by referencing the person’s state registration form.
•	Issue no Gordon permit.  We simply keep their information on file and enter it in our system
•	Check the appropriate box for student, faculty/staff, etc.
•	Record zero “0” fee.  Motorcycles are free to register.
•	Initial and date the Gordon registration card.
•	Write “Motorcycle” at the top of the form and file it in the completed registrations box.

10.2	Temporary Passes (App. Temp Pass)
Students and guests who will have a vehicle on campus overnight that is not already registered with us will need to receive a temporary pass.  Temporary passes can be issued for situations such as a new car that still has temporary plates, a student borrowing a car for the weekend, the registered car is in the shop and the student has a rental, etc.

Visitor Passes
Visitor passes are good for 3 days (the CSD mandated maximum length of overnight stay for guests on campus) and are free or charge.  Visitors can park in marked visitor’s spaces or the chapel lot for overnight parking.  To issue the pass:
•	Click “Visitor 3-Day” on the home screen in MasterPhone.
•	Search for the host student’s name.  Once you find it, ask the visitor for his or her cell phone number.
•	Fill in the vehicle information and submit the form.  It should print out to the dispatch printer.  Sign the sheet and inform the visitor where he or she should park.
Short-Term Passes
Short-term passes are good for 7 days and cost $5. Students may not receive more than 2 passes per quad. Students who already have a car registered on campus who wish to receive a pass (borrowing a different car, car is in the shop) will not be charged the $5 fee.  Students are required to follow all normal lot restrictions while they have a temporary pass.  To issue the pass:
•	Enter the student’s ID number and click “Student Pass” on the home screen in MasterPhone.
•	Verify the name of the student and click “continue”.
•	Explain that unless the student already has a car registered on campus, he or she will be charged $5 to his or her student bill.
•	Record the student’s cell phone number.
•	Select “Resident” or “Commuter” and fill out the vehicle information.
•	Submit the form and it should print out at the dispatcher computer.  Sign the form and explain the parking regulations.
Staff Passes
If a faculty/staff member has a car temporarily that they do not wish to register, we can issue them a 2 or 4-week pass.
•	Enter the person’s staff ID number and click “STAFF Temp. Pass”.
•	Follow the same steps as issuing a student pass, but ignore the fee, as it is free for this pass.
•	If the staff member wants a pass for longer than a month, suggest that he or she registers the car the normal way, as it is also free of charge.

10.3	Bicycle Registration (App. Bike Cards)
We require students to register their bikes if kept on campus. Bike registration is free. When someone comes in to register a bike:
•	Have him or her fill out a bike registration card.  These are in a small black box on the windowsill.
•	All fields must be completed before we can accept the card and issue a sticker.
•	If someone has problems finding the serial number, either the ACDC or officer can help him or her locate it.
•	Issue them a reflective sticker and instruct them to put it in a visible spot on a permanent portion of the bike (i.e. not on the seat, pedals, handlebars, or wheels).
•	Fill in the sticker number on the card, as well as your initials and the date, and place in the bike registrations box.

Section Eleven: Keys
11.1	Key Sets for Campus Workers
11.2	Returning Campus Issued Keys
11.3	Lynn Van Keys
11.4	Wilson House Guests
________________________________________
Because we are open 24/7, Rodgers Reception Center is a convenient location for key pickup, drop off, or return. Various types of keys will be handled in different ways.

11.1	Key Sets for Campus Workers
On the wall in the office is a locked box containing key sets used on campus.  Only officers, the ACDC and dispatchers are permitted to know the combination to the key box.  If someone comes in wanting to check out or return a set of keys, ask for the person’s name and what department (or company if it is a contractor) he or she works for.  Verify the person’s name on the permission list on the front of the key box.  If the individual’s name is not on the permission list, please radio the officer or ask the ACDC to verify the individual.  After working a shift for a few weeks, you should begin to get a feel for who will come in to pickup/drop off keys.  After verifying the individual, open the key box:
•	Enter the 4-digit combo.  The numbers can be in any order, as long as you use the correct numbers.
•	If the correct combo has been entered, you can turn the black knob to open the box.
•	If you entered the wrong combo, the knob will not unlock the box.  In this case, slide the rectangular “reset” button down until it clicks.  Enter the combo again.
•	You must follow all of the instructions on the permissions list.  NEVER check the keys out to people who are not on the list.  If you feel there may be an exception, an officer must be the one to check out the keys.
•	When checking the keys out, enter it on the checkout log, writing the name, company/department, date & time and your initials.  Repeat this same process when returning keys.
•	If you think someone should be added to the list, please inform the ACDC.

NOTE:  If you are found responsible for giving the key box combo to a person other than another currently employed dispatcher, officer or the ACDC, you will be permanently dismissed.

11.2	Returning Campus Issued Keys (App. Key Return Log)
Public Safety handles key returns for the Physical Plant locksmith.  Key return information is kept on a log located on a clipboard on the wall near the customer service desk.
•	WE DO NOT RECEIVE RESIDENTIAL OR HALL KEYS.
o	These keys should be returned to CSD or the issuing RD.
•	We do receive keys being returned at the end of a period of issue from students and faculty/staff.
o	These include classroom, office, lab, academic building keys, and master keys.
o	Dispatchers are authorized to sign a Faculty/Staff termination check sheet.
•	Keys should be placed in the white key box on the shelf under the customer service counter.
•	Record the return on the Key Return Log.
o	Include your initials, the name that the keys were issued to, the person’s ID number, and the numbers that are imprinted on the keys that are being returned.

We have no authority over key distribution or fining.  Any specific key requests and questions should be referred to Physical Plant (specifically the locksmith).  Currently, Leo Cleary is the locksmith.

11.3	Lynn Van Keys (App. Lynn Van Sign-Out)
Gordon in Lynn operates several vehicles for students to get to and from programs off campus. The vehicles are usually parked in the strip of spaces near the chapel and the keys are kept at RRC with the van checkout log.  The Gordon in Lynn program is in charge of van scheduling and driver authorization.  Our only responsibility is to ensure that all of the information is filled out in the checkout log and to check the driver’s license of the person taking the keys.  There is a space for you to initial to indicate that you have seen the person’s driver’s license.  The Lynn sign-out form and vehicle keys are kept beneath the service counter.

If the person checking out keys is not sure which vehicle he or she should be taking, or is not sure of the time he or she should be returning the vehicle, you can verify it on the Lynn Van Calendar feature in MasterPhone.  Currently, Gordon in Lynn uses a Google calendar to display their weekly schedule for vehicle use.
•	Click the “Lynn Van Calendar” button.
•	You will be prompted with the login name (oce.gordon).
•	The password is “ocegordon”.
•	You cannot make changes to the calendar.
We also occasionally sign out Admissions vehicles, which follows the exact same procedure with three major exceptions:
•	Instead of the blue Lynn sign out sheets, you will use the admissions sign out sheets on the black clipboard that is usually right under the Lynn clipboard.
•	Any person signing out the Admissions vehicle must be on the list of approved people that is affixed to the clipboard itself (under the sign out sheets).
•	The person signing out the Admissions vehicle must leave their Gordon ID with you which you can put in the ID holder until their return.  You must still verify they have their drivers license with them, but do not keep that as a substitution for the Gordon ID as it is illegal to operate a motor vehicle without a license in possession in the state of MA.  As with any time we take an ID as collateral (excepting key box), affix a sticky note with the reason we have the ID as collateral, your initials, date, and time.

11.4	Wilson House Guests
There is a box in the office on the window sill to the right of the monitors for Wilson House guest keys and information. We should receive a note from the President’s Office before the arrival of a guest for Wilson House.  These guests are usually important visitors to the college, such as board members or campus guest speakers. You should routinely check this box so that you can be aware of who the guests are and when they are coming. When a Wilson House guest arrives, give them their keys and any applicable information.  In addition, radio the officer that the Wilson House guest has arrived, so the officer can escort them up to the guest suite.


Section Twelve: Lost and Found
12.1	Receiving Found Items
12.2	Searching for Lost Items
12.3	Lost and Found Pickup
12.4	Lost and Found Clean Out
________________________________________
12.1	Receiving Found Items (App. New Items Log)
Items may be turned in by an individual, but also frequently come in via custodial or intercampus mail. Regardless of how the item is received, the procedure is the same.
•	Immediately fill out an entry in the Lost & Found check-in log, which is located in the back of the office on the new items drawer. Fill out as much information as possible, including a detailed description of the item.
•	Be sure to tag the item. Tags frequently escape, so ensure they are securely fastened, use tape if necessary.
•	If there is information available about the owner of an item (an ID in a wallet, name inside of a book, entry for ‘home’ in cell phone book, etc.), attempt to contact the person and note any action taken on the log, as well as on a note securely fastened to the item.
•	Also check the Lost Items log in the clipboard file by the window near the customer service counter to see if anyone may have already reported the item missing.
•	Place ALL items in the blue NEW ITEMS drawer. The only exceptions to this are cash, credit cards, or other valuable items (such as electronics), in which case ask the officer to place them in the safe.  Mark the log accordingly.

12.2	Searching for Lost Items (App. Lost Item Log)
If a person comes to RRC or calls in looking for a lost item:
•	First, search the computer database.  Narrow the search by category if possible and click search.
•	If a match is not found in the computer, look in the new items drawer and scan the log there to see if the item may have been placed in the safe.
•	If the item is not found here, inform the customer that we do not have the item, but we can take down his or her information and call him or her if the item comes in.
•	Fill out the Lost Items log appropriately.

12.3	Lost and Found Pickup (App. Lost & Found Pickup Log)
When a person comes in to claim an item,
•	Fill out an entry in the Lost & Found PICKUP log (on the wall by the customer service counter).
•	You must check the person’s ID before you return any item, regardless of the item’s supposed value.
o	This is in part because of security, but also because we want to have a record of where the item went in case someone else comes in looking for the same item at a later date.
o	To check the ID of a person who has lost a wallet/purse, you may compare a photo ID found in the wallet to the person coming to claim the item.

12.4	Lost and Found Clean Out
After a period of 30 days (60 days for valuable items), the ACDC will clean out items from lost and found.  Individuals who turned items into lost and found, but who wanted to keep the item if it went unclaimed, will be contacted to pick up the item.  These should still be handled using the Lost and Found Pickup log.

For all other items, members of Public Safety, including dispatchers, are allowed to claim items.  Dispatchers must inform the ACDC of the item they want to claim.  Please do not take things from lost and found without permission.  The ACDC will alert you when the item is available to take with you.  All other items older than 30 days will be donated or thrown out, depending on the item and its condition.  They will be marked in the database as “Donated” or “Trashed”.

In order to be fair, unclaimed valuable items in lost and found will be handled via a silent auction, with the money going towards a worthy cause (Gordon missions trips, etc.).  If more than one person claims the item, the highest bidder will win.  If multiple people bid an equal amount and no one surpasses that amount, the names will be entered into a blind raffle.

________________________________________
13.1	BCA Alarm Calls
Gordon uses an outside security service to protect the galleries in BCA. Alarm calls regarding the galleries will come in on the outside emergency line (phone above the dispatch console) and you will speak to a live person about the situation. If you receive a call from the alarm company, radio the officer about the situation.  The caller from the alarm company may ask for your name.  These calls should be followed up with expediency.

13.2	Bennett Security Alarms
The Bennett Center has a security alarm which is routed through the Fire Computer Work Station in the Dispatch Area. When a door alarm is tripped in Bennett, you will receive a TROUBLE ALARM through the fire alarm system. On the “normal” fire alarm monitor, you will see a yellow supervisory trouble alarm.  In the “new events” list it should say something like this: “Supervisory Alarm – Bennett”

NOTE:  At this point, you still don’t know whether it is a normal fire-related trouble alarm or the security alarm. To determine this, you will need to DOUBLE-click on the new event (just like with fire alarms and other trouble alarms). Then (just like with fire alarms) you will want to read the MIDDLE line in the black section at the bottom of the screen. The middle line should say something like this:
“Track Supervisory – BENNETT SECURITY PANEL SECURITY PANEL”

Please note that the wording might be slightly different each time, but it should always include the word “Security.”  Again, just to be clear, you will NOT see the word “Security” in the new event when it first appears; you will only see it on the middle line when you double-click the new event.  If the alarm comes in during hours that Bennett is open, please call the front desk and tell the student worker that you just received an alarm and ask him or her if an officer is needed.  If the Bennett center is closed or there is no response at the Bennett front desk, radio the officer.

13.3  Wilson House Security Alarms
The Wilson House (president’s residence) is set up with a security system similar to the Bennett Center.  This is set up mostly to alert the occupants of the house if the door is opened and a child is potentially running loose.  It is also used as a typical Security System for when the family is away.  These alarms will come in similar to the Bennett Center Supervisory Alarms on the fire computer work station but will be blue and characterized as a security alarm (and appear in blue) rather than a supervisory alarm (in yellow) and will also say “security” in the middle line in the black section at the bottom of the screen. However, where it would say Bennett” it will say “Wilson House.”  Due to the nature of the disability of one of the president’s children it is IMPERATIVE that these security alarms at the Wilson House be dispatched to the officer IMMEDIATELY.  You should then log the event as you would any security alarm.  If you receive a phone call from the president alerting you that everything is ok, inform the officer that you have received the call, however the officers still must respond to the residence and you still must dispatch the event.  The president knows this, but you can remind them (or his wife/family/babysitter) at the time they call that the officer will still come by and thank him for calling.

13.4	Growth Chamber Automated Messages (App. Growth Chamber Procedure)
If you receive an automated phone message saying that the Growth Chamber in the Ken Olsen Science Center has gone into alarm status, notify the officer and he or she will check out the room for anything obviously wrong. Once the officer has checked the room, ask if him or her if you should contact professor Stan Reczek or Dr. Ming Zheng.  If told to call, first try their offices and then their homes and cells. If you are unable to reach them, leave messages.  A paper copy of the procedure is in the at-hand information binder.

13.5	Bookstore Alarm Calls
The Gordon College Bookstore is owned and operated by Follett Corporation. Follett employs an outside alarm company to monitor the bookstore areas. If you receive a call regarding an alarm you should get the name of the person calling and the location of the alarm and relay this information to the Duty Officer immediately (if possible, keep the caller on the line in case the officer has a follow-up question he or she wants answered). The officers will follow up appropriately.

13.6	Lane Deliveries
Morning deliveries for Dining Services may come as early as 3am. If the baker has not arrived yet, you should radio the officer to let the delivery worker into the Lane.  If the baker has already arrived, you should call the downstairs kitchen to alert them that they have an incoming delivery.  There is no need to worry about this after the building is opened in the morning.

13.7	Mail Delivery
When the mail delivery comes for the office during the day, it will be dropped off at the counter.
•	You should sort this mail into the mailboxes at the back of the office.
•	If anything is in a yellow intercampus mail envelope, remove it from the envelope before placing in the proper box unless it is marked as private or confidential.
•	There is a box for the intercampus mail envelopes where you may place the empty envelope.
•	Anything addressed to Public Safety with no identifying officers’ name may be put in the Chief’s box.

13.8	Other Deliveries
We occasionally receive other deliveries for members of the campus community, such as flowers or lost luggage. Note: During normal business hours (M-F 0800-1630), all deliveries should be directed to the mailroom. Public Safety only receives deliveries during non-business hours, weekends, and holidays (in other words when the mailroom is not staffed).
•	You should contact the recipient, letting them know to come and pick up the item (see section 2.5).
o	If it is a perishable item (flowers, food, etc.), it is best to call the recipient’s cell phone, if they have one.  Use email if the party cannot be reached.  Whether you speak to the recipient directly or leave a message, be sure to request that they pick up their item(s) ASAP.
•	Leave a note on the delivery on the desk, indicating what you have done to locate the recipient, as well as the date, time and your initials.  If you need a paperclip to affix a note to a card or envelope, you can obtain one from above the ACDC’s computer.
•	If items are in the office when you come in:
o	Check the status of the item from the note.
o	Follow up as necessary.
Faculty/Staff may also ask to leave items with us as we are open 24 hours a day for pickup. When someone leaves an item, clearly label it with:
•	The name of the person dropping off and a contact number.
•	The time/date of the drop off.
•	The name of the recipient.
•	The expected time/date of pick up.
•	Any other important information.
•	Your initials, the date, and time.

13.9	Van Testing (App. Van Test App, NH & PA App.)
In order to drive a college-owned vehicle, faculty, staff or students must first obtain a van license. Public Safety is only responsible for testing individuals. Reserving vans, key pickup and key drop off are handled through Physical Plant.  If someone comes in requesting information regarding van testing or calls regarding van testing:
•	Instruct them that the application, information booklet, and outline of the procedure can all be found online at the Go site.  They should click on departments, then public safety, then van testing on the left side of the screen.
•	Ask the applicant if he or she is an Alaska, Georgia, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, or a Washington state resident.  These states require a separate form to release a driver history. These forms can also be found beneath the service counter in the van test tray.  If the person is neither an NH nor PA resident, they only need a normal release form.
•	The applicant must complete and return the form to Public Safety along with a receipt from the Cashier’s office for $15 before they can complete the three (3) on-line modules.  This fee is not our “testing fee”.  It is the fee for the driver history to be obtained.
•	When the receipt and application are dropped off check that all of the sections have been filled out. Fill out the top box in the “Public Safety Office Use Only” section at the bottom of the sheet marked “Dispatcher Use.”
•	Check that they either have a receipt for the fee, or the sponsoring department section is filled out (current faculty and staff are exempted from the fee).
•	Check the state listed on their license in the information section and if their state is AK, GA, NH, PA, or WA, make sure the appropriate additional release form is also attached.
•	Place the application and all accompanying forms in the “completed van test forms” box by the cork boards in the back of the office.
•	The van-testing officer will sign the applicant up for an online test.  The applicant will receive an email with the test information and will need to complete the online test at least 48 hours before the scheduled van driving test day. The email will come from a company called “sonic e-learning.”
•	After a person has completed the online testing modules, he or she can sign up for a test (posted on the bulletin board in the back of the office).
o	We assign the time slots; the applicant does not choose (except with permission from the van-testing officer). Fill in the schedule from the earliest available time onwards, with no holes.
o	If they cannot come in at the next available time on the sheet, have them check back later to sign up for a different time.
o	Van test slots usually fill up fast—frequently we will have a standby list in case people do not show up.
It would be helpful if during your first few shifts you read through the information brochure yourself for a better understanding of the process.  If at any point an applicant has a question that you cannot answer, ask the officer on duty, if the officer on duty does not know the answer, instruct them to email publicsafety@gordon.edu and the van testing officer will reply with an answer when they are next in the office.

13.10	Citation Petitions (App. Citation Petition)
If someone comes in requesting a citation petition, you can find the petitions in the file trays beneath the service counter.  The owner of the vehicle should fill in all requested info as well as the reason(s) he or she feels they should have their citation waived.  If the citation was written for expired plates, the owner will need to bring in his or her new/up to date registration and show the duty officer, who will then sign their petition.  Be sure to initial and date the petition form before putting it into the completed petitions folder.  Students have 10 calendar days from the date that they receive a citation if they wish to file petitions.  Visitor of the campus wishing to appeal a citation may check the box at the bottom of the citation and fill in all of the empty information fields at the top of the citation and the fee will be waived.  These filled out citations should be put in the data entry box.  Students CANNOT appeal Wenham/Town tickets through our office.  They must follow the procedure on the ticket itself.
13.11	RAD
When the RAD program is being offered, there is a safe box on top of the monitors in which you can put RAD checks.  RAD registration is $15.  We only accept checks for payment for the class. Checks are made out to Gordon College with RAD in the memo line.

13.12	Borrowing Items From DPS
If people need to borrow anything from the office (shovels in the winter, scrapers to remove old parking stickers, etc) always take an ID as collateral. There is a holder for them by the window. Anytime you take an ID as collateral for this purpose, you must affix a sticky note to the ID with the item it is collateral for, your initials, the date and the time

13.13	Parking Details
During parking details, give the parkers a timesheet when they come in. Check the parker timesheet folder to ensure they only receive one timesheet.  Also supply the parkers with vests and flashlight wands (if necessary) from the boxes under the front counter.  Ask the parkers if any of them are parking for us for the first time.  If they are, obtain a payroll authorization form from the file drawer under the dispatch desk and have them fill out their name and ID number and put the authorization form in the ACDC’s mailbox to be completed so that they can be paid.

13.14	Shovelers
In the winter, morning shifts may be asked by Physical Plant to call for shovelers or plow drivers. In that event, either M50 or M51 will provide the dispatcher with call list. Shovelers will report to Physical Plant and you should call down the list until you have obtained the number of shovelers needed for the particular situation.  Usually, the officer will be the one to call M50 or M51 during a snow emergency.  The call list can also be found on the Go site under departments and then physical plant.

13.15	Public Phone and Phonebook
A phone with an off campus number and a local phonebook are kept under the customer service counter. If a customer needs to make a call, they should use this phone. Use this phone sparingly as it is also the same line as our off-campus emergency phone line.
